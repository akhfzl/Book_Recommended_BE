 PrefaceI am immensely proud to present the 5th Edition of the Quirk marketing textbook
" 
It is now 6 years since we began work on the first edition, and it’s quite amazing 
to see how much it has grown"
" Not only in line with the changes in our industry, 
but also through very important input from our passionate and kind community of learners and educators"
" 
The evolution of the discipline of marketing is best represented by the change in 
the subtitle of our book"
" When we started, this book was called eMarketing: the essential guide to digital marketing"
" Today as you will see, we have adjusted this 
to eMarketing: the essential guide to marketing in a digital world"
" This change 
has been an easy and natural one"
 It underlines an important shift in the way we think about and engage with digital
 Digital is not a channel in the same way that a marketer might view television or radio as a channel
" Instead digital is a way of 
life"
 It is the experiential glue which binds previously separated media together
" 
Because of this, digital enables a cohesive brand experience that wasn’t previously on offer"
" In fact, it’s highly likely that within the next edition or two, we will need 
to acknowledge this shift in the role of digital by ditching the “e” in eMarketing"
" At 
best it is quickly becoming passé, at worst it will become completely redundant"
" 
At Quirk, we no longer see ourselves as a digital marketing agency, but rather as 
a marketing agency born digital"
" We still consider ourselves to be experts in the 
digital realm and as digital natives we still have bits and bytes coursing through 
our veins"
" However it is because of our understanding of brands and how to build them in a digital world that our clients are turning to us for far more than just a 
website or some SEO"
" Today we find ourselves as lead agency on a number of 
prestigious brands"
 These brands see that their customers are living in a digital world and therefore trust a partner like Quirk to lead them in that world
" 
Our textbook is now used in almost 1000 academic institutions globally"
" This is 
largely due to brave and forward thinking educators to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude"
" They have walked a journey with us, embraced a book published 
by an agency (a fact which hasn’t gained easy acceptance by the very traditional 
academic community), and have provided us with tremendous encouragement and invaluable feedback to ensure that this book keeps pace not only with a fast moving 
industry, but with their evolving needs as well"
"
We believe in education"
" Educated people make better decisions and have more 
potential for an improved life"
" We also believe that particularly for tertiary education 
to have an effective future a partnership between the private and academic sectors 
is vital"
" It ensures the very best education is as accessible as it can be to as many 
people as possible"
" By making our textbook available for free online we hope to 
propel this dream forward"
"  In fact, less than 10% of the many institutions who use our book actually pay for it and we are thrilled by this"
 At Quirk we want to make a dent in the world and this is an important part of us achieving that
""
"vi viiAnother important change for this edition has been the appointment of our 
academic partner, Red & Yellow, who have helped us improve the pedagogy and 
academic rigour of the textbook"
" Founded twenty years ago in 1994, Red & Yellow 
is one of South Africa’s leading marketing colleges"
 Last year Quirk Education merged with Red & Yellow to form an academic institution which we believe will serve its students very well into the future
" This new entity combines Red 
& Yellow’s tremendous experience in marketing’s academic space with Quirk’s 
digital skills and online training expertise"
" Relevant and practical content can thus be delivered through the methodology best suited for the student – online, 
contact or a hybrid of both"
" In order to effectively join forces, we must see the end 
of the Quirk Education brand"
" This is slightly sad for me, but is part of an important evolution and I am immensely excited about the high quality of students Red & Yellow is already producing at this early stage of their combined adventure"
" The 
future holds great promise indeed"
"
 From a content perspective, this book is a real step up from the previous edition"
" As 
with the 4th Edition, we’ve maintained Quirk’s Think, Create, Engage and Optimise 
structure"
" We have, however, worked much harder to acknowledge the useful 
links between disciplines throughout the book"
" The lines between disciplines 
in the media landscape can be blurry, but we find the TCEO structure gives us 
an effective way of tackling the big picture explanation for comprehension"
" This 
foundation then enables us to focus on the nuance where the rubber hits the road"
"
 Apart from a general update of facts, stats and case studies, we’ve made a few 
other important changes"
" Firstly the Think section has been expanded, with a 
much improved market research chapter and the addition of content strategy chapter as well"
 The section is better equipped as a platform for approaching the rest of the book and the marketing process in general
" In the Create section 
we’ve added a chapter on User experience design and in the Engage section the 
Video Marketing and Mobile chapters have been greatly expanded to reflect their growing importance in the marketing landscape"
"
 
The last update is a valuable one for readers of the printed edition"
" Because the book is available for free download we wanted to give you extra reason to part 
with your hard earned cash when buying a printed copy"
"  To achieve this, we’ve 
partnered with many great vendors to provide a wide array of useful vouchers that will help you get started with what you learn from this book"
"
 I started Quirk almost 15 years ago"
" Whilst we’ve grown successfully as a business 
over that time this textbook remains my proudest achievement even though I didn’t 
write it"
" I may have had the original idea, but it’s a team effort and I wouldn’t want 
to take that away from the people who have worked so hard to make it a reality"
 Putting each edition together takes a huge amount of work by many people
 My name is on the front purely because someone’s name has to be on the front
" 
Thankfully the font gets smaller and smaller every year"
"
In particular I want to recognise Kat Scholtz who has overseen the production of 
this 5th Edition"
" I have worked with Kat for over 5 years now and you just couldn’t 
find a better qualified person to lead such an effort"
" I mean this both from a skills and experience perspective as well as the deep passion and excitement Kat has for producing a great resource which we know will help many hundreds of thousands 
of people"
" Kat has also surrounded herself with a phenomenal knowledge team 
whose job it has been to synthesize the knowledge of our agency into an easy to use guide which is accessible to all"
" To Kat and her team, from the bottom of my 
heart I thank you so very much for your incredibly hard work in making this dream 
a reality"
 You deserve all the credit for this fantastic book
" 
I’m proud of the book because it genuinely is good and it is genuinely free"
" To 
have brought Quirk to a place where it can afford to make this contribution to our 
industry and community is an incredible feeling"
"
 We hope you enjoy our book and remember, the most important thing any human 
can do is teach, even if you’re not a teacher"
" Share your knowledge and make the 
world a better place"
" 
Onwards and upwards!
 
Rob"
Some thoughts on Marketing from Seth Godin
"
I don’t think you’ll learn much from this textbook"
" It’s nothing specific--I actually 
don’t think you can learn how to market from any textbook"
" As marketing textbooks 
go, this is a very good one, but still, it’s not going to work"
"
It’s not going to work because marketing is about nuance, experience, 
experimentation and passion"
" And I don’t have a clue how you could start from 
scratch and learn that from a textbook, no matter how good"
"
So, what to do?
The first thing you should do is obsess about the terms in this book"
" Vocabulary
is the first step to understanding, and if you don’t know what something means,figure it out"
 Don’t turn the page until you do
"
Second, get out of the book"
 Go online
 Go market
"There are very few endeavors that are as open to newcomers, as cheap and as easy 
to play with"
 You can’t learn marketing without doing marketing
 Go find a charity or a cause or a business you believe in and start marketing
 Build pages
 Run ads
" 
Write a blog"
 Engage
 Experiment
"
If you don’t learn marketing from this process (the book for vocabulary, the web 
for practicing) then you have no one to blame but yourself"
" You’ve already made the 
first step, don’t blow it now"
" 
We need you"
 Market what matters

I found eMarketing: The essential guide to digital marketing to be an excellent 
guide on digital marketing"

would need on digital marketing"

Phillip Leacock,Digital Marketing Director, Sears Home ServiceseMarketing is comprehensive and a ‘must have’ for anyone wanting to gain a 
more thorough understand of digital marketing"

working in the digital space, and ‘recommended’ for those involved in advertising, 
PR, social media and other areas that are ‘touched’ by digital"

I have found myself dipping in and out of it over the past few months, reaching for 
it when I needed more information on a particular area of digital marketing, or clarification of a technical term or phrase"
"
Trevor Young, Director of strategy and innovation, Edelman Australia
If you aren’t a marketer, this is a must have book; if you know a marketer, do him 
or her a favour and get it for them; if you are just interested in eMarketing and want 
to expand your general business knowledge, buy two copies – someone will want to borrow them from you"

both a study guide and a practitioner’s reference manual"

 First wordsThe first edition of eMarketing: the essential guide to digital marketing was published in 2008
" 
It wasn’t our plan to write the equivalent of a book every year – but rapid sales, along with the ever-shifting digital landscape and an edition that was published exclusively in the United States means that we are now on our fifth edition"
 This is an achievement that we are very proud of
"  
Once again, we have drawn on the expertise of professionals and agencies in our network and 
used their feedback to ensure that this book is representative of the most recent developments in our fast-paced industry"
"
This edition has a slightly different title: eMarketing: the essential guide to marketing in a digital 
world"
 This reflects our insight that digital is more than just a channel and that the basic principles of marketing remain the same; we simply have an ever-evolving array of technology to apply them through
" 
The book is structured similarly to the fourth edition, enabling readers to follow it sequentially 
and get an overview of how the different elements of digital fit together, while also providing a guide for those who want to dip in and out of chapters or need to brush up on specific areas"
"
The book is structured according to how the Quirk agency works: 
•	Think: we research, plan and strategise for brands and campaigns
•	Create:  we build beautiful, highly functional assets and content for those brands 
and campaigns
•	Engage:  we use the power of the connected web to drive traffic to those assets and leverage the available channels to build strong customer relationships
•	Optimise: we relentlessly use data and analysis to improve all our marketing efforts 
Some of the content is wholly new (Content Strategy, User Experience Design), some of it has been conceptually overhauled (Digital Strategy, Mobile Marketing, Web Development and Design, Market Research, CRM, Video Marketing) and some of the core topics remain similar but are fully up to date to reflect the latest changes in industry globally"
" 
Within each chapter, there are notes along the way to point you in the direction of further 
material and, at the end of each chapter, there are links to some great blogs or books relevant to that chapter"
" If you want to keep up to date, these resources are a great place to start"
" 
When you’ve finished reading, the next important step is to start doing! Put what you have 
learnt into action"
" Throughout the book, we have listed low- and no-cost ways to get started – all that’s needed is your brain, some enthusiasm and some time"
" There are several vouchers in the print edition of the textbook, so you can get started with the practical application of what you have read"
" If you don’t want to experiment with your own business, help out a friend!
Good luck and have fun"
" 
Wishing you digital success,
The QuirkStars"

Situating 
digital in 
marketing"
4 51
"1 Introduction
 
Today, no marketing strategy is complete if it does not incorporate digital strategy 
and expression"
" Understanding digital requires thinking beyond any one tool or 
channel, and towards an exchange of value: an economic system trading with 
attention as currency"
" 
What is digital? Bud Caddell defines ‘digital’ as “a participatory layer of all media that allows users to self-select their own experiences, and affords marketers the ability to bridge media, gain feedback, iterate their message, and collect 
relationships” (Caddell, 2013)"
" In other words, digital is a new way of exploring 
content (for users) and connecting with customers (for marketers)"
"
Digital is not just a set of marketing channels – it’s a different way of thinking about how people engage with media, each other and the world around them"
" Digital 
enables you to segment your audience and customise messages in a valuable and 
measurable way"
" The availability of information, our inherent desire to contribute, and user-friendly technology have rewritten the rules of engagement"
" People are not passive consumers; they are empowered as publishers, editors and 
commentators"
" The conversation is multi-directional and usually not started or 
controlled by brands"
"
In this chapter, you will gain:
• An understanding of the role digital can play in a marketing plan
• An approach to reaching people in a world of digital tools
• Insight into how to get the most out of this textbook
1"
"2 Understanding marketing
 
Before we can delve into digital marketing, it’s important to understand the 
fundamentals that underpin marketing itself"
" After all, digital marketing has the 
same purpose, intentions and objectives"
"
Dr Philip Kotler defines marketing as follows, “Marketing is that function of the 
organisation that can keep in constant touch with the organisation’s consumers, 
read their needs, develop products that meet these needs, and build a programme 
of communications to express the organisation’s purposes”"
"
(Kotler and Levy, 1969: p 15)"

"3 Understanding digital marketing
 
How does digital marketing fit into this definition? There is, in fact, no basic difference between ‘traditional’ marketing and digital marketing"
"  They are one 
and the same"
"
Ultimately, the aim of any type of marketing is to keep customers and stimulate 
sales in the future"
" Digital communication tools make it possible to connect and 
build long-term relationships with customers"
" 
Digital marketing helps to create consumer demand by using the power of the 
interconnected, interactive web"
" It enables the exchange of currency but, more than that, it enables the exchange of attention for value"
" This is referred to as the 
attention economy"
"
Digital marketing is powerful in two fundamental ways"
" First, the audience can be 
segmented very precisely – even down to factors like current location and recent brand interactions – which means that messages can (and must) be personalised and tailored specially for them"
"
Second, the digital sphere is almost completely measurable – every minute and 
every click by a customer can be accounted for"
" In digital you can see exactly how 
various campaigns are performing, which channels bring the most benefit, and 
where your efforts are best focused"
"

"1 Crowdsourcing 
 
Crowdsourcing is a powerful example of the way digital tools have enabled certain ways of thinking"
" In simple terms, crowdsourcing is a distributed 
problem-solving and production model that relies on an active community 
to find solutions to problems"
 Crowdsourcing relies heavily on the tools and communication forms made possible by the Internet
"
Given that the Internet connects people all over the world through different 
publishing tools and technologies, the information and ideas on these channels 
have become commodities in themselves"
" In the past, we had to gather physically 
to create crowds"
" Now, with technology, crowds can be closely connected while being geographically distant"
" 
By listening to the crowd and asking for their contributions, organisations 
can gain first-hand insight into their customers’ needs and desires, and build 
products and services that meet those needs and desires"
" With an earned sense of ownership, communities may feel a brand-building kinship with the community through collaboration and contribution"
 Situating digital in marketing  ›  Understanding digital marketing Situating digital in marketing  ›  Introduction
"6 7Using the Internet, a savvy organisation can tap a wider range of talent and 
knowledge than is contained in its own resources"
" Tapping into this resource 
can be done in one of three ways:
1"
" Crowdsourcing, which involves asking and enabling people to share their 
ideas or creations in exchange for an emotional or monetary reward"
" This 
is the most common type used for marketing and idea generation"
 Websites such as Threadless (www
threadless
"com), Idea Bounty (www"
ideabounty
"com) 
and Wikipedia (en"
wikipedia
org) are prime examples of crowdsourcing
"
2"
" Crowdfunding,  which involves asking many people in a large crowd each 
to donate a small amount of money in order to gather a large sum to fund 
a specific project or venture"
 Kickstarter (www
kickstarter
"com) is a well-known platform where people who want to start projects can ask for backers 
to fund them"
" The higher the contribution, the more the backer will receive 
once the project is complete"
"
3"
" Microtasking,  which involves breaking a big task or project down into tiny 
components and asking many people to each complete a few of these components, usually for payment"
 One company that uses microtasking is BrandsEye (www
brandseye
"com), which pays members of its crowd to evaluate the sentiment behind mentions in social media"
"
Communities that use crowdsourcing platforms exist for different reasons"
" 
Some exist because there are people who have a keen interest in and affinity for 
those brands"
 They participate in the community because they want to improve the products and services they receive
 Others want to gain a monetary reward or the prestige of devising the winning solution
"
Whatever the case, crowdsourcing demonstrates the power of the Internet – it 
connects people, builds communities, spreads messages, and taps into a global 
source of ideas and inspiration"
"

"2 Digital audiences
 
Both the media landscape and people’s media habits have changed"
" There are many fragmented and highly specific niche communities at play across multiple 
digital media channels"
"
At the same time, people’s attention is fragmented by the many new media 
channels and tools available – on top of traditional media, we now have social 
networks, emails, web tools, mobile devices and more splitting our attention"
" With so many choices and too little time, audiences have become very skilled at 
ignoring marketing messages"
 Figure 1
 The ways in which people use digital media
" (Source: InMobi,2012)
 
The key to succeeding is two-fold: ideas must be remarkable, and you must find a 
niche group who are obsessed with your product and willing to devote their scant 
attention to it"
" These fans may tell their friends and, in doing so, spread the word 
over their interconnected digital networks"
 If most consumers are likely to ignore your marketing message then the goal is to speak to those who are actually listening
"
This leads to another key digital consideration"
" These days, people themselves are 
media channels"
" After all, most of us create, share, comment on and link to content 
that we find interesting – or that we think will interest our friends and followers"
" 
These personalised digital broadcasts are intercepted by people who are interested in what we are saying and have chosen to listen to us"
" Through this, individuals have become conduits for information, ideas and news in a powerful way"
"

"8 9This exchange of ideas comes down to creating communities and nurturing 
relationships"
 Digital helps us to understand these relationships better
"

"3 Segmenting and customising messages
 
All of these ideas about niche communities, influential media personalities and fragmented attention spans tie in to the ability to segment online audiences and 
customise messages"
"
Segmentation is the process of taking a single, general audience and dividing 
it up according to specific groupings or characteristics"
" Once this is done, each 
group can be targeted differently depending on their needs from the brand"
" For example, a bank may serve a wide range of customers, but the messages it sends 
to segments such as young high-income earners, small-business owners and 
retirees will be very different – necessarily so"
"
Digital offers a wealth of user information, the ability to target users based on 
these factors, and the availability of technology for creating and managing large databases"
" In digital marketing segmentation, customers can be reached across 
a wide range of communication channels depending on their preferences and 
needs"
" The focus should not be on separate channels, but on how digital channels 
can enable and work with the strengths of what may be considered ‘traditional’ 
media such as TV or billboards"
" Today, digital often plays the role of a bridge for customers between different marketing media, allowing them to respond to a 
broadcast message on TV through a social media property for instance, where 
they can obtain a deeper, richer and more interactive brand experience"
"
Once an audience segment has been created, the message sent to it can also 
be customised (often automatically) thanks to the availability of the necessary information and digital tools"
" This can be as small as adding the customer’s name 
to an email greeting, or as significant as tailoring an entire page of content to their 
buying history, connections and brand interactions"
" For example, Amazon provides product recommendations to users based on the items that they have bought as 
well as similar products purchased by others"
"
Figure 3"
 Amazon recommends items based on past purchases and views

"4 Measurability
 
The second factor that distinguishes digital is its measurability"
" Because of the 
technology on which it is built, almost every action on the web can be tracked, 
captured, measured and analysed"
" 
The benefit for marketers should be clear"
" While traditional media are undoubtedly 
effective, it’s sometimes hard to know exactly what is working, how well it’s 
working, and why"
" Digital can help you pinpoint the success of campaigns down to the channel, audience segment, and even time of day"
"
Figure 4"
" Measuring online data can tell you, for example, when the best time is to 
send an email"
" (Source: Harvest Retail Marketing, 2013)
Web analytics – the discipline of tracking, analysing and drawing insight from online data – can also go a step further to helping a marketer understand the 
audience’s intent"
" While the data merely answers what people are doing, looking at this in conjunction with other insights can help you understand why they are 
doing it as well"
" 
Measurability in digital is not just about understanding the technology, although 
that is a necessary first step"
" It’s about understanding how people and technology 
intersect – with the ultimate goal of using this information to craft the most effective and relevant marketing messages"
" As Kotler would say, it circles back to the notion of “creating and satisfying customers at a profit” (Kotler, 1991)"
"

"5 The TCEO model
 
There are many models for approaching digital marketing but we have found it most effective to group it into four interrelated disciplines: Think, Create, Engage 
and Optimise"
" This grouping creates a process that will result in the optimal use 
of digital tactics"

"10 11The diagram below illustrates the interrelation between the disciplines and 
highlights how the Optimise function should be present at each stage:
THINK is the starting point in our approach"
"  It is tasked with developing strategic 
plans for the digital world"
" Like traditional communications planning, it includes 
topics such as consumer insights, research, concept development, budget 
allocation and channel planning"
"
CREATE brings concepts to life by executing campaigns and shaping platforms"
" 
It covers all aspects of creating web assets, from web design and development to conceptual copywriting, the creation of social media assets, mobile development, engineering business systems and social media integration"
"
ENGAGE is responsible for driving traffic and building relationships"
" Media buying 
and planning, search engine optimisation, email marketing, social media and 
campaign management are some of the key activities here"
"
OPTIMISE is about continuous improvement"
" It delivers insight and lessons 
through analytics, data mining, conversion optimisation and testing"
 Optimise is relevant at each stage of the process
"

"4 Accounting for change and how to use 
this book
 
It must be acknowledged that the term ‘digital’ is becoming increasingly insufficient 
for discussing the topics shared in this chapter"
" The idea of an analogue system 
is increasingly irrelevant and so referring to something as ‘digital’ can suggest a very broad meaning that, at its worst, is so vague that it becomes meaningless"
" eMarketing, the title of this book, is also a term that has lost some relevance since our first edition"
" As the field matures and the effect of digital thinking, for lack 
of a better phrase, becomes both more evident and acknowledged, terms and 
practices will evolve to account for this"
"
For those with inquisitive minds who would like an introduction to how the Internet 
itself works (and we know there are many of you!), we have included a break down as an appendix at the back of this book"
" There you will also find a history of the 
Internet"
" Both sections contain valuable information that will likely inform your 
interactions on this powerful medium"
" 
At its core, marketing is about conversations and the Internet has become a hub 
of conversations"
 The connected nature of the Internet allows us to follow and track these conversations and provides entry points for all parties
" What follows in 
this book are ways of conversing with existing and potential customers using the 
Internet"
 This textbook can be read from back to front or used as a reference guide
" Key terms, concepts and interrelated subjects are highlighted in each chapter"
" Apply the knowledge you gain for success and let us know how it goes!

"1 Introduction
A strategy indicates the most advantageous direction for an organisation to take 
over a defined period of time"
" It also outlines which tactics and means should be 
used to execute this direction"
" Originating as a military term, strategy is about 
using your strengths, as well as the context in which you are operating, to your advantage"
" 
In marketing, strategy starts with understanding what the business wants to 
achieve, or what problem it wants to solve"
" It then considers the context in which 
the business and its competitors operates, and outlines key ways in which the 
business and brand can gain advantage and add value"
" 
In this chapter, you will learn:
• How to define and distinguish business strategy, marketing strategy 
and digital strategy
• The key building-block concepts that are essential to any strategy
• The questions that need to be asked when assembling a digital marketing strategy

"3 What is marketing?
 
A simple definition for marketing is that it is the creation and satisfaction of 
demand for your product or service"
" If all goes well, this demand should translate 
into sales and, ultimately, revenue"
" 
In 2012, Dr Philip Kotler defined marketing as “the science and art of exploring, 
creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market at a profit"
" 
Marketing identifies unfulfilled needs and desires"
" It defines, measures and quantifies the size of the identified market and the profit potential” (Kotler, 2012)"
"
In order to motivate people to pay for your product or service, or to consider your 
organisation superior to your competitors, you need to create meaningful benefits 
and value for the consumer"
" The value that a marketer should seek to create 
should be equal to or even greater than the cost of the product to the consumer"
" Doing this often and consistently enough will grow trust in and loyalty towards the 
brand"
""
18 192
"4 What is digital marketing?
 
If marketing creates and satisfies demand, digital marketing drives the creation 
of demand using the power of the Internet, and satisfies this demand in new and 
innovative ways"
 The Internet is an interactive medium
" It allows for the exchange 
of currency, but more than that, it allows for the exchange of value"
" 
A business on the Internet can gain value in the form of time, attention and advocacy 
from the consumer"
" For the user, value can be added in the form of entertainment, enlightenment and utility; content marketing is one powerful way to create value"
" 
The reciprocity of the transaction is what’s important here – in other words, the 
exchange is a two-way street that provides benefit to both parties simultaneously"
"
The Internet has changed the world in which we sell"
" It is not a new marketing 
channel; instead, it creates a new paradigm for the way in which consumers connect with brands and with each other"
" The complete scope of marketing is 
practised on the Internet – products and services are positioned and promoted, 
purchased, distributed and serviced"
" The web provides consumers with more choice, more influence and more power"
" Brands have new ways of selling, new products and services to sell, and new markets to which they can sell"
" 
The roles played by marketing agencies are shifting too"
" So-called ‘traditional’ 
agencies are getting better at digital marketing, while agencies that started out 
as digital shops are starting to play in the traditional advertising space"
" More than ever, integrated strategies that speak to an overall brand identity are vital to achieving an organisation’s goals"
" Consumers are increasingly more fluent in their 
movement across channels and in their use of multiple of channels at once"
" They 
expect the same from the brands with which they connect"
 Anyone still thinking in the old ‘traditional versus digital’ dichotomy is sorely out of date
"
However, marketing on the Internet does not mean throwing out the rule book 
on marketing and business principles"
" Instead, the Internet provides a new 
environment in which to build on these"
 Profit is still revenue less cost
" The Internet 
does not change that"
"
Brands build loyalty among users who love their products or services"
" Users fall 
in love with products and services when their experience is tailored to their needs, and not the needs of the brand"
" More than any other type of marketing, digital 
marketing is measurable"
" This gives brands the opportunity to build tailored, 
optimised brand experiences for consumers"

"1 Business and brand strategy
 
Before you can delve into marketing strategy, take a step back and consider the business and brand with which you are working"
" 
The end-goal of any business is to make money, in one way or another"
" Business 
strategy asks the questions: ‘What is the business challenge we are facing that 
prevents us from making more revenue?’ or, ‘What business objective should we 
strive for in order to increase the money in the bank?’
The brand is the vessel of value in this equation"
" The brand justifies why the 
business matters, and what value its adds to people’s lives"
" The value of the brand is measured in terms of its equity – how aware are people of the brand? Does it 
hold positive associations and perceived value? How loyal are people to the brand?
When you have the answer to this question, you can formulate a marketing strategy 
to address the challenge or objective you’ve discovered"
"
2"
5
"2 Marketing strategy
 
The purpose of a marketing strategy is to address a business or brand challenge or objective that has been revealed"
" An effective strategy involves making a series 
of well-informed decisions about how the brand, product or service should be 
promoted; the brand that attempts to be all things to all people risks becoming unfocused or losing the clarity of its value proposition"
" 
For example, a new airline would need to consider how it is going to add value to 
the category and differentiate itself from competitors; whether their product is 
a domestic or international service; whether its target market would be budget travellers or international and business travellers; and whether the channel would be through primary airports or smaller, more cost-effective airports"
" Each of these 
choices will result in a vastly different strategic direction"
"
To make these decisions, a strategist must understand the context in which 
the brand operates: what are the factors that affect the business? This means conducting a situational analysis that looks at four pillars:
1"
" The environment
2"
" The business
3"
" The customers
4"
" The competitorsDigital Marketing Strategy  ›  Understanding marketing strategy Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  What is digital marketing?
NOTE
What brand interactions 
have you had that 
you actually consider 
valuable?"
"20 21Out of this, you can determine what the brand or product’s unique selling point 
(USP) is"
" A USP is the one characteristic that makes your product or service better 
than the competition’s – what unique value does it have? Does it solve a problem 
that no other product does? 
Understanding customers
In order truly to understand your customers, you need to conduct market research (discussed in much more detail in the next chapter)"
" Try not to make assumptions 
about why people like and transact with your brand – you may find their values and 
motives are quite different from what you thought"
" Ongoing research will help you build a picture of what particular benefit or feature your business provides to your customers, allowing you to capitalise on this in your marketing content"
"
One important area on which to focus here is the consumer journey – the series of 
steps and decisions a customer takes before buying from your business (or not)"
" 
Luckily, online data analytics allow you to get a good picture of how people behave on your website before converting to customers; other forms of market research will also help you establish this for your offline channels"
" 
On the Internet, a consumer journey is not linear"
" Instead, consumers may engage 
with your brand in a variety of ways – for example, across devices or marketing 
channels – before making a purchase"
"
Figure 2"
 The customer journey is cyclical
" 
 
(Source: Adapted from Brilliant Noise, 2012)Here are some considerations and tools for conducting your brand’s situational 
analysis"
" 
Understanding the environment
The environment is the overall context or ‘outside world’ in which the business functions"
" It can involve anything from global economics (how well is the local 
currency performing these days?) to developments in your industry"
" Every brand 
will have a specific environment that it needs to consider, based on the type of product or service it produces"
"
An analysis of the business and brand environment will typically consider political, 
economic, social, technological, legal and environmental (PESTLE) influences to identify a clear set of considerations or issues pertinent to the marketing strategy"
"
Understanding the business
There are several marketing models that can be used to understand the business and brand you are working with"
" Since it’s essential for all marketing messages 
to encapsulate the brand’s identity and objectives, this is a very important step"
"
A crucial consideration is the brand itself"
" What does it stand for? What does it 
mean? What associations, ideas, emotions and benefits do people associate with 
it? What makes it unique?
There are several levels of branding to investigate:

"22 23The goal is to reach customers with the right marketing message at the right 
stage of their journey"
" For example, you may want to use aspirational messages for 
someone in the exploration phase, but focus on more direct features and benefits 
(such as a lower price) when they’re almost ready to buy"
"
Understanding competitors
Finally, it’s important to know who else is marketing to your potential customers, what they offer, and how you can challenge or learn from them"
"
On the Internet, your competitors are not just those who are aiming to earn 
your customers’ money; they are also those who are capturing your customers’ 
attention"
" With more digital content being created in a day than most people could 
consume in a year – for example, over 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute (YouTube, 2013) – the scarcest resources these days are time, focus 
and attention"
"
When considering competition, it’s also worthwhile looking at potential 
replacements for your product"
" The Internet is disrupting and accelerating the 
pace of disintermediation in a number of industries, meaning that people can now go directly to the business instead of transacting through a middleman (look at the travel industry as an example)"
" To stay ahead, you should be looking at potential disruptors of your industry as well as the existing players"
"

"3 Digital marketing strategy
 
Once you have a clear sense of what the business challenge or objective is, and you have defined how your marketing strategy will work towards fulfilling it, you can 
start thinking about your digital marketing strategy"
"
Consider that in the early days of TV, when the new medium was not as yet 
entirely understood, there were separate ‘TV planners’ who created a ‘TV strategy’ for the brand"
"  Over time, this was incorporated into the overall 
marketing strategy (as it should be)"
"
The same is going to happen with digital"
" Increasingly, digital thinking is being 
incorporated into marketing strategy from day one"
" This section considers 
digital strategy separately in order to highlight some differences in approach, but this should change in practice over time"
"
Digital marketing strategy builds on and adapts the principles of traditional 
marketing, using the opportunities and challenges offered by the digital medium"
" 
A digital marketing strategy should be constantly iterating and evolving"
" Since the Internet allows for near-instantaneous feedback and data gathering, digital marketers should constantly be optimising and improving their online marketing efforts"
"
User-centric thinking, which involves placing the user at the core of all decisions, 
is vital when looking at building a successful digital marketing strategy"
" The 
digital marketing strategist of today is offered not only a plethora of new tactical 
possibilities, but also unprecedented ways of measuring the effectiveness of chosen strategies and tactics"
" Digital also allows greater opportunities for interaction and consumer engagement than were possible in the past, so it is important to consider 
the ways in which the brand can create interactive experiences for consumers, not 
just broadcast messages"
"
The fact that digital marketing is highly empirical is one of its key strengths"
" 
Almost everything can be measured: from behaviours, to actions and action paths, to results"
" This means that the digital marketing strategist should start thinking 
with return on investment (ROI) in mind"
" Built into any strategy should be a testing 
framework and the ability to remain flexible and dynamic in a medium that shifts and changes as user behaviours do"
"
If we defined strategy as ‘a plan of action designed to achieve a particular outcome’, 
the desired outcome of a digital marketing strategy would be aligned with your organisation’s overall business and brand-building objectives or challenges"
" For 
example, if one of the overall objectives were acquisition of new clients, a possible 
digital marketing objective might be building brand awareness online"

The following building-block techniques will help you structure a marketing strategy – both online and offline – that addresses your core business challenges"
"  
These strategy models are just starting points and ways to help you think through 
problems; as you grow in experience and insight, you could find yourself relying on 
them less or adapting them"

"1 Porter’s Five Forces analysis
 
Porter’s Five Forces analysis is a business tool that helps determine the competitive intensity and attractiveness of a market"
" The Internet’s low barrier to entry means 
that many new businesses are appearing online, providing near-infinite choices for customers"
" This makes it important to consider new factors when devising a 
marketing strategy"
"NOTE
The customer journey 
answers the question: 
‘What do people 
really want from your 
brand, and what would 
convince them that you 
offer this?’

crowd?’Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  The building blocks of marketing strategy Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  Understanding marketing strategy"

"2 The Four Ps
 
The Four Ps of marketing help you structure the components that make up a 
brand’s offering, differentiators and marketing"
" They have been fundamentally 
changed by the Internet and need to be looked at in the context offered by digitally 
connected media and from the perspective of the consumer"
 How your brand is positioned in the mind of your consumer will ultimately determine your success
"
1"
" Products (and services) 
Products and services are what a company sells"
" The Internet enables business 
to sell a huge range of products, from fast-moving consumer goods and digital 
products such as software, to services such as consultancy"
" Online, the experience 
the user has in discovering and purchasing can be considered part of the product the brand provides"
"
The Internet has enabled mass customisation"
" For example, Nike (nikeid"
nike
"com) 
and Converse (www"
converse
"com) allow customers to customise their own 
trainers"
" The Internet as a distribution medium also makes it possible for products 
such as software and music to be sold digitally"
" 
2"
" Price 
The prevalence of search engines and of shopping comparison websites, such as 
www"
pricerunner
co
"uk, www"
pricecheck
co
za/ and www
nextag
"com, makes it 
easy for customers to compare product prices across a number of retailers; this 
makes the Internet a market of near-perfect competition (Porter, 2008)"
"These stories then go on to build connections between people, ideas, brands and products"
" Communities of people follow truly great brands because they want to 
be part of their stories"
 Apple is a good example of a brand with a dedicated tribal following
 People want their products; they want the world to know that they have an iPhone or a Macbook
 This kind of tribal following spells success for any brand
"
With price differentiation becoming a challenge, especially for smaller players 
in the market, businesses need to consider differentiating on value"
" Value is a 
combination of service, perceived benefits and price, where customers may be willing to pay a higher price for a better experience, or if they feel they are getting something more than just the product"
"
3"
" Placement (or distribution) 
Product distribution and markets no longer have to be dictated by location"
" Simply 
by making their products visible online (for example, on a website or Facebook 
page), brands can reach a global market"
 The key is to reach and engage customers on the channels they are using – this is why choosing your digital tactics is vital
" You want to engage customers on their terms, not yours"
"
Technology such as APIs, SOAP services, RSS and XML allow information and 
services to be distributed throughout the world"
" For example, the API for a hotel 
reservations database allows a diverse range of websites to offer instant online 
bookings for hotels in the inventory"
" 
4"
" Promotion 
The Internet, as an information and entertainment medium, naturally lends itself 
to promoting products"
" The online promotional mix is an extension of the offline, but with some significant differences"
" For one, online promotion can be tracked, 
measured and targeted in a far more sophisticated way"
" 
But promotion doesn’t just mean advertising and talking at customers – on 
the Internet, it’s crucial to engage, collaborate and join conversations, too"
" 
Interacting with customers helps build relationships, and the web makes this sort of communication easy"
" That’s why a good portion of this book is devoted to 
engagement tactics and tools"
"
5"
" A new P: People
In addition to the existing Four Ps, the Internet requires you to consider a new 
P: People"
" This element speaks to examining the powerful human element that the digitally connected world permits: personalisation, peer-to-peer sharing, 
communities, and consumer- centric organisations that allow people to participate 
in the brand story"

NOTE
The 4Ps have been 
expanded by various academics to include many different concepts"
 The core ideas remain - how are you positioning the essential components of your offering to own space in the minds of your audience?
26 27The Cluetrain Manifesto (1999) describes markets as ‘conversations’
" Humans 
are storytellers; brands create stories, myths and legends around their products 
and services"
" Ultimately, what people say about your product or service is a story 
and now, more than ever, consumers are helping to craft the stories that define organisations"
"

"3 SWOT analysis
 
A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis is an ideal way to understand your business and your market"
" 
Figure 4"
 SWOT analysis
"
Always have a purpose in mind when conducting a SWOT analysis"
" For example, 
study the external threats to your business, and see how learning from these can help you overcome internal weaknesses"
" This should tie back in to your business 
and marketing objectives – strengths should be promoted, opportunities should 
be sought out, while threats and weaknesses should be minimised as much as possible"
 A SWOT analysis is part of a situational analysis and identifies the key issues that direct the marketing strategy
"

"7 Crafting a digital marketing strategy
 
Any activity with an end goal (whether it’s winning a war, building a city or selling 
a product) should have a blueprint in place for every person in the organisation to follow"
" In digital marketing, however, there is no single definitive approach – each 
business must create its own roadmap"
" However, there are questions you can use 
to guide the process"
" 
A strategy needs to cover the questions of who you are, what you are offering and 
to whom, as well as why and how you are doing so"
" The steps and questions below 
cover what an organisation should be aware of when creating and implementing a strategy that will meet its marketing objectives and solve its challenges"
"
1"
" Context
The first step in crafting a successful strategy is to examine the context of the 
organisation and the various stakeholders"
" We’ve covered this under marketing 
strategy earlier in this chapter, but it bears repeating:
• What is the context in which you are operating (PESTLE factors) and how is this likely to change in the future?
• Who are you, why does your brand matter and what makes your brand useful and valuable?
• Who are your customers, and what needs, wants and desires do they have?
• Who are your competitors? These may extend beyond organisations that 
compete with you on the basis of price and product and could also be 
competition in the form of abstracts such as time and mindshare"
"
Thorough market research will reveal the answers to these questions"
"
2"
" Value exchange
Once you have examined the market situation, the second step is an examination 
of your value proposition or promise: in other words, what unique value your organisation can add to that market"
 It is important to identify the supporting value-adds to the brand promise that are unique to the digital landscape
" What 
extras, beyond the basic product or service, do you offer to customers?
The Internet offers many channels for value creation"
" However, the definition 
of what is ‘valuable’ depends largely on the target audience, so it is crucial to research your users and gather insights into what they want and need"
" 
Content marketing is the process of conceptualising and creating this sort of 
content – examples of value-based content include a DIY gardening video for a 
hardware brand, a research paper for a business analyst, or a funny infographic for a marketing company"

NOTE
PESTLE is discussed in 
more detail earlier in this chapter"
""
28 293
" Objectives
When setting your digital marketing goals, there are four key aspects to consider: 
objectives, tactics, key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets"
" Let’s look at 
each one in turn"
"
 >Objectives
Objectives are essential to any marketing endeavour – without them, your strategy 
would have no direction and no end goal or win conditions"
" It’s important to be able 
to take a step back and ask, ‘Why are we doing any of this? What goal, purpose or 
outcome are we looking for?’
• What are you trying to achieve? 
• How will you know if you are successful?
Objectives need to be SMART: 
• Specific – the objective must be clear and detailed, rather than vague and general"
"
• Measurable – the objective must be measurable so that you can gauge 
whether you are attaining the desired outcome"
"
• Attainable – the objective must be something that is possible for your brand to achieve, based on available resources"
"
• Realistic – the objective must also be sensible and based on data and trends; don’t exaggerate or overestimate what can be achieved"
"
• Time-bound – finally, the objective must be linked to a specific timeframe"
"
 >Tactics
Objectives are not the same as tactics"
" Tactics are the specific tools or approaches 
you will use to meet your objectives – for example, a retention-based email 
newsletter, a Facebook page, or a CRM implementation"
" As a strategy becomes 
more complex, you may have multiple tactics working together to try to achieve the 
same objective"
" Tactics may change (and often should), but the objective should remain your focus"
 We’ll look at tactics in more detail in the next section
" >Key performance indicators (KPIs)
KPIs are the specific metrics or pieces of data that you will look at to determine whether your tactics are performing well and meeting your objectives"
" For 
example, a gardener may look at the growth rate, colour and general appearance 
of a plant to evaluate whether it is healthy"
" In the same way, a marketer will look at a range of data points to determine whether a chosen tactic is delivering"
" KPIs are determined per tactic, with an eye on the overall objective"
"
 >Targets
Finally, targets are the specific values that are set for your KPIs to reach within a specific time period"
" Sportspeople need to reach targets to advance their careers 
– for example, come in the top ten to qualify for the final, or run 10km in under 
 
27 minutes"
" If you meet or exceed a target, you are succeeding; if you don’t reach it, 
you’re falling behind on your objectives and you need to reconsider your approach 
(or your target)"
" 
 
Here is an example:
SMART objective:
• Increase sales through the eCommerce platform by 10% within the next 
six months"
"
Tactics: 
• Search advertising
• Facebook brand page
KPIs per tactic: 
• Search advertising – number of search referrals, cost per click on the ads
• Facebook brand page – number of comments and shares on campaign-specific posts
Targets per tactic: 
• Search advertising – 1 000 search referrals after the first month, with a 10% month-on-month increase after that
• Facebook brand page – 50 comments and 10 shares on campaign-specific posts per weekDigital Marketing Strategy  ›  Crafting a digital marketing strategy Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  Crafting a digital marketing strategy"

" Tactics and evaluation
Many digital tools and tactics are available once you have defined your digital 
marketing objectives"
" Each tactic has its strengths – for example, acquisition 
(gaining new customers) may best be driven by search advertising, while email 
is one of the most effective tools for selling more products to existing customers"
"
The table below expands on some of the most popular tactics available to digital 
marketers and their possible outcomes"
 These will be covered in far more detail in the Engage section of this book
"
Tactic Outcome
SEO Customer retention and acquisition
This is the practice of optimising a 
website to rank higher on the search engine results pages for relevant search terms"
" SEO involves creating relevant, fresh and user-friendly content that search engines index and serve when people enter a search term that is relevant to your product or service"
"SEO has a key role to play in acquisition, as it ensures your organisation’s offering will appear in the search results, allowing you to reach potential customers"
" A site that is optimised for search engines is also a site that is clear, relevant and well designed"
" These elements ensure a great user experience, meaning that SEO also plays a role in retention"
"
Search advertising Sales, customer retention and acquisition
In pay-per-click or search advertising, the advertiser pays only when someone clicks on their ad"
 The ads appear on search engine results pages
The beauty of search advertising is that it is keyword based
 This means an ad will come up in response to the search terms entered by the consumer
" It therefore plays a role in sales, acquisition and retention"
 It allows the advertiser to reach people who are already in the buying cycle or are expressing interest in what they have to offer
"
Online advertising Branding and acquisition
Online advertising covers advertising in all areas of the Internet – ads in emails, ads on social networks and mobile devices, and display ads on normal websites"
The main objective of display advertising is to raise brand awareness online
" It can also be more interactive and therefore less disruptive than traditional or static online advertising, as users can choose to engage with the ad or not"
" Online advertising can be targeted to physical locations, subject areas, past user behaviours, and much more"
"
Affiliate marketing Sales and branding
Affiliate marketing is a system of reward whereby referrers are given a ‘finder’s fee’ for every referral they give"
"Online affiliate marketing is widely used to promote eCommerce websites, with the referrers being rewarded for every visitor, subscriber or customer provided through their efforts"
 It is a useful tactic for brand building and acquisition
"Video marketing Branding, customer retention and value creation
Video marketing involves creating video content"
" This can either be outright video advertising, or can be valuable, useful, content marketing"
"Since it is so interactive and engaging, video marketing is excellent for capturing and retaining customer attention"
" Done correctly, it provides tangible value – in the form of information, entertainment or inspiration – and boosts a brand’s image in the eyes of the public"
"
Social media Branding, value creation and participation
Social media, also known as consumer-generated media, is media (in the form of text, visuals and audio) created to be shared"
 It has changed the face of marketing by allowing collaboration and connection in a way that no other channel has been able to offer
"From a strategic perspective, social media is useful for brand building, raising awareness of the brand story and allowing the consumer to become involved in the story through collaboration"
" Social media platforms also play a role in building awareness, due to their shareable, viral nature"
 They can also provide crowdsourced feedback and allow brands to share valuable content directly with their fans
"
Email marketing Customer retention and value creation
Email marketing is a form of direct marketing that delivers commercial and content-based messages to an audience"
" It is extremely cost effective, highly targeted, customisable on a mass scale and completely measurable – all of which make it one of the most powerful digital marketing tactics"
 Email marketing is a tool for building relationships with potential and existing customers through valuable content and promotional messages
" It should maximise the retention and value of these customers, ultimately leading to greater profitability for the organisation as a whole"
" A targeted, segmented email database means that a brand can direct messages at certain sectors of their customer base in order to achieve the best results"
"
 
 
Once the objectives and tactics have been set, these should be cross-checked and re-evaluated against the needs and resources of your organisation to make sure 
your strategy is on the right track and no opportunities are being overlooked"
"
5"
" Ongoing optimisation
It is increasingly important for brands to be dynamic, flexible and agile when 
marketing online"
" New tactics and platforms emerge every week, customer behaviours change over time, and people’s needs and wants from brand evolve as 
their relationship grows"
" The challenge is to break through the online clutter to 
connect with customers in an original and meaningful way"
"
This process of constant change should be considered in the early stages of 
strategy formulation, allowing tactics and strategies to be modified and optimised 
as you go"
" After all, digital marketing strategy should be iterative, innovative and 
open to evolution"
Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  Crafting a digital marketing strategy Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  Crafting a digital marketing strategy
"32 33Understanding user experience and the user journey is vital to building successful 
brands"
" Budget should be set aside upfront for analysing user data and optimising 
conversion paths"
" 
Social thinking and socially informed innovation are also valuable and uniquely 
suited to the online space"
" Socially powered insight can be used to inform strategic 
decisions in the organisation, from product roadmaps to service plans"
" Brands have moved away from being merely present in social media towards actively using 
it, aligning it with actionable objectives and their corresponding metrics"
" This is 
critical in demonstrating ROI and understating the opportunities and threats in the market"
"
Managing the learning loop (the knowledge gained from reviewing the performance 
of your tactics, which can then be fed back into the strategy) can be difficult"
" This is 
because brand cycles often move more slowly than the real-time results you will 
see online"
" It is therefore important to find a way to work agility into the strategy, allowing you to be quick, creative and proactive, as opposed to slow, predictable and reactive"

"1 One-line summary
 
Nike transformed its marketing strategy by embracing key digital strategies such as data analytics, social engagement and storytelling"
"
2"
8
"2 The problem
 
As one of the biggest sports brands in the world, Nike was not struggling for exposure or attention"
" However, the brand was noticing that its traditional, big-budget advertising strategy was seeing 
fewer returns over time"
" 
The biggest market for Nike products consists of young people between the ages of 15 and 25, 
who spend 20% more with Nike than any other group"
" But these Generation Y customers weren’t 
paying attention to big, top-down media, and were looking for a brand that offered constant change and innovation, not just the same old thing over and over"
"
Nike realised that it needed a new approach to reach this digital audience"
"
2"
8
"3 The solution
 
Understanding that marketing in the digital age is a conversation, not a monologue, Nike dropped 
its spending on TV and print advertising by 40% between 2010 and 2012 – but increased its overall 
marketing budget to $2"
4 billion in 2012
"Nike chose to use a combination of technological innovations, data analytics and social media 
engagement to reach this new, digitally savvy audience"
" 
Engineers and scientists associated with prestigious organisations such as MIT and Apple were 
hired to build exciting new technologies and examine market insights"
" One of their biggest accomplishments was the creation of Nike+ in 2010 – a device that lets users track their exercise 
regimens, upload these to the web, monitor their progress, and share their achievements socially"
" 
The product range grew to include the Nike FuelBand"
"
This new community created incredible volumes of data, which Nike used to track behaviours, 
create online communities and spaces for Nike fans, and build meaningful relationships between the brand and its customers"
" Nike moved its social media marketing team in-house so that it had 
a closer connection to this data and the conversations being generated by its fans"
"
 
Nike also embraced a range of other digital best practices:
•	 A strong focus on storytelling: Nike advertising shifted from delivering one core ‘big 
message’ about its products to talking about inspiration, aspirations and overcoming odds"
" 
For example, Nike’s ‘I Would Run To You’ ad (essentially a funny short film) shows the story 
of a long-distance couple reconnecting by running across the country to see each other"
"
•	 Being an authentic brand: The storytelling approach creates authenticity and a sense of community"
" Nike also strives to understand and engage with the subcultures of each 
sport, talking to them in the vernacular they are familiar with"
"
•	 Understanding and communicating with customers on their terms: When Nike created 
its big-budget ‘Write The Future’ ad for the 2012 World Cup, featuring soccer superstars Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, it flighted the ad on Facebook and YouTube rather 
than on TV"
" Having seeded to a community and primed it with teasers, the ad received 8 million views in the first week and went viral"
"
•	 Being remarkable and shareable: Nike put up a 30-storey digital billboard in Johannesburg, South Africa that was populated with constantly-updating user tweets, creating a buzz 
around the campaign"
"
•	 Allowing mass customisation: The Nike iD online store lets fans create their own custom 
shoe designs and have them shipped"
" The concept earned Nike over $100 million in its 
first year"
"

"4 The results
 
Nike’s new approach – harnessing data for user insight and creating a diverse, social and engaged 
digital strategy – has had excellent results"
Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  Case study: Nike digital strategy Digital Marketing Strategy  ›  Crafting a digital marketing strategy
"34 35Nike reaches over 200 million fans every day in an interactive dialogue, rather than having to rely 
on big sponsored events such as the Super Bowl or World Cup to reach this number"
"
The massive volumes of freely shared user data produce meaningful brand insights, lead to 
product innovations, and allow the brand to get closer to consumers"
"
In addition to this:
• Nike share prices rose by 120% between 2010 and 2012 – an important consideration, 
since every business aims to make money, after all"
"
• Nike+ experienced a 55% growth in membership in 2012 – as of June 2012, 7 million users have signed up for the service, and the majority of these connect with the brand several 
times each week to upload and review their exercise data"
" 
• As of August 2013, the main Nike Facebook page has over 15 million likes, the Nike 
Football page has 19"
"4 million likes, and the Nike Basketball page has over 5 million – posts typically see a high level of interaction and discussion"
"
• Similarly, on Twitter, the brand is also engaging millions of fans – 1"
"7 million on the core Nike account, 1"
2 million on the brand’s US-based Nike
"com store account, and 1"
4 million on the Nike Football account
"

"9 The bigger picture
 
All of the chapters in this book are linked to digital marketing strategy in one way or another"
" 
A solid business and brand strategy should be the starting point of any marketing venture, and you 
should always keep one eye on it as you develop specific campaigns, platforms and approaches"
" After all, you should always remember that you are trying to reach your chosen audience by 
communicating to them in the most effective way, to build lucrative long-term relationships"
"
While strategy helps you understand the questions you should ask, market research is the process 
used to answer them"
" From there, content marketing strategy helps you put your ideas into practice, creating materials that engage, enthral, convert and retain customers"
"
2"
"10 Summary
 
Strategy is the essential first step in positioning your brand within the market and creating a roadmap 
for achieving your business goals"
" While there are many different paths one can take, there is a clear 
process for understanding where you are, where you need to be, and how you will get there"
It all starts with understanding the business challenges that your brand faces
" From here, an effective marketing strategy looks at the market context, weighs the available options and makes 
important choices, based on solid research and data"
" Digital marketing strategy adds a layer of 
technology, engagement and iterative optimisation into the mix"
 The wide variety of tools and tactics offered by the digital medium should inform your strategic choices
"
Digital marketing strategy is highly empirical and your strategic thinking should be mindful of ROI 
and how it can be measured"
" This will allow you to optimise your tactics and performance in order 
to create a valuable brand story, an excellent user experience, the most optimised conversion 
funnels, and the highest ROI"

The Internet is built for research"
" Whether it’s a consumer shopping around for 
prices, a researcher exploring a topic or a fan looking up their favourite band, the 
Internet makes finding and analysing information easier than ever before"
" That’s 
because everything people do online leaves a data footprint"
"
Consumers are able to research companies and products easily, gathering 
information to compare prices and services with a few clicks of the mouse"
" Consumers are also able to share likes and dislikes easily, whether that information 
is shared with companies or with friends"
"
This process can also work in reverse: brands can study who their customers are, 
what they are interested in, how they feel about the brand, and the best times and 
places to engage with them"
 This is what online market research is all about
"
In this chapter, you will learn:
• Why online market research is crucial to any marketing endeavour
• The most important concepts you need to know in order to start 
conducting research
• Several methods for conducting online research, including surveys, online focus groups and online monitoring
• What problems and pitfalls to avoid when researching online

Market Research  ›  Introduction
"42 43If you are able to understand your customers and the greater business context, you 
will be able to market more effectively to them, meet their needs better, and drive 
more positive sentiment of your brand"
" All of this adds up to happier customers 
and, ultimately, a healthier bottom line"

"4 Key concepts in market research
While the research field can be full of complex terminology, there are four key concepts you should understand before conducting your own research:
• Research methodology
• Qualitative and quantitative data
• Primary and secondary research
• Sampling

"1 Research methodology
 
A research methodology is the process you should follow in order to conduct accurate and valuable research"
" Research should involve certain steps:
1"
" Establish the goals of the project
2"
" Determine your sample
3"
" Choose a data collection method
4"
" Collect data
5"
" Analyse the results
6"
" Formulate conclusions and actionable insights (for example, producing 
reports)
Most often, market research is focused around specific issues unique to a business or brand"
" It is therefore not always possible to get hold of comparable information 
to aid decision making"
 This is why it can be useful to start from a specific research problem or hypothesis
"
Your research question should guide your entire process, and will determine your 
choice of data collection method (more on those later)"
"Market Research  ›  Key concepts in market research
online"
" Technology plays a key role in gathering data and connecting with research participants, and makes the whole process quicker and easier to manage than 
traditional offline research methods"
"
Traditional and online market research have the same goals and underlying 
principles, but online market research has the benefit of using digital technology, 
which provides a range of benefits:
• The Internet is always on, meaning that data are readily available at any time"
"
• Many of the processes for finding, gathering and storing data can be automated (for example, you can get an automatic email alert if someone mentions your brand, or you can set up self-administered digital surveys)"
"
• You have access to a large number of participants around the world at the click of a button"
"
• A lot of the information you will use is already being automatically collected (such as web analytics and social media data) – all you need to 
do is access it"
"
• People are often happy to share their own research, insights and 
methodologies online, so you can access this trove of resources to inform 
your own research"
"
• Online market research can be much more cost effective and quick to set 
up than traditional research techniques"
"
There are many reasons why you should conduct regular market research:
• Gain insights into your consumers – this can include:
o What customers want and need from your brand
o What customers like and dislike about the brand
o Why customers buy the brand’s products or services
o Why potential customers might choose your brand over another one
o Why (or why not) customers make repeat purchases
• Understand the changes in your industry and business
• Discover new market trends on which you can capitalise
• Find new potential sales avenues, customers, products and more
• Find and engage new audiences
• Allow customers to help steer your businessMarket Research  ›  The importance of market research
NOTE
Remember that 
comments made on 
social networks cannot 
represent the views 
of your entire target 
market"
" The validity 
of any data must be 
considered in light of 
your research design"
""
"44 45Customer communications are also a source of data that can be used, particularly 
communications with the customer service department"
" Committed customers 
who complain, comment or compliment are providing information that can form 
the foundation for researching customer satisfaction"
"
Social networks, blogs and other forms of social media have emerged as forums 
where consumers discuss their likes and dislikes, and can be particularly vocal about companies and products"
" These data can, and should, be tracked and 
monitored to establish consumer sentiment"
" If a community is established for 
research purposes, these should be considered primary data, but using social media to research existing sentiments is considered secondary research"
"
The Internet is an ideal starting point for conducting secondary research based on 
published data and findings"
" But with so much information out there, it can be a 
daunting task to find reliable resources"
"
The first point of call for research online is usually a search engine, such as 
 
www"
google
com or www
yahoo
com
" Search engines usually have an array of 
advanced features, which can aid online research"
" For example, Google offers:
• Advanced search (http://www"

"2 Primary and secondary research
 
Research can be based on primary data or secondary data"
" Primary research is 
conducted when new data is gathered for a particular product or hypothesis"
" This is 
where information does not exist already or is not accessible, and therefore needs 
to be specifically collected from consumers or businesses"
" Surveys, focus groups, research panels and research communities can all be used when conducting primary market research"
"
Secondary research uses existing, published data as a source of information"
" It 
can be more cost effective than conducting primary research"
" The Internet opens 
up a wealth of resources for conducting this research"
" The data would, however, 
originally have been collected for solving problems other than the one at hand, so they may not be sufficiently specific"
 Secondary research can be useful in identifying problems to be investigated through primary research
"
The Internet is a useful tool when conducting both primary and secondary research"
" 
Not only are there a number of free tools available when it comes to calculating 
things such as sample size and confidence levels (see the section on Tools of the 
trade for some examples), but it is also an ideal medium to reach large numbers of people at a relatively low cost"
" 
The Internet and secondary research
Research based on secondary data should precede primary data research"
" It should be used in establishing the context and parameters for primary research:
• The data can provide enough information to solve the problem at hand, thereby negating the need for further research"
"
• Secondary data can provide sources for hypotheses that can be explored 
through primary research"
"
• Sifting through secondary data is a necessary precursor for primary research, as it can provide information relevant to sample sizes and 
audience, for example"
"
• The data can be used as a reference base to measure the accuracy of primary research"
"
Companies with online properties have access to a wealth of web analytics data that are recorded digitally"
 These data can then be mined for insights
" It’s worth 
remembering, though, that it’s usually impossible for you to access the web 
analytics data of competitors – so this method will give you information only about your own customers"

" Using data such as search

" However, when data is measurable and 
specific, such as impressions and clickthrough rates, it leads to quantitative 
research"
"

"4 Sampling
 
Qualitative research is usually conducted with a small number of respondents in order to explore and generate ideas and concepts"
" Quantitative research is 
conducted with far larger numbers, enough to be able to predict how the total 
population would respond"
"
Sample size is an important factor in conducting research and should be 
representative of the population you are targeting as a whole"
" If your business transacts both online and offline, be aware that using only online channels for 
market research might not represent your true target market"
" However, if your 
business transacts only online, offline channels for your market research are less necessary"
"NOTE
Read more about this 
in the Data Analytics chapter"
"Market Research  ›  Key concepts in market research
The Internet and primary research
Primary research involves gathering data for a specific research task"
" It is based 
on data that has not been gathered beforehand"
" Primary research can be either 
qualitative or quantitative"
"
Primary research can be used to explore a market and can help to develop the 
hypotheses or research questions that must be answered by further research"
" 
Generally, qualitative data is gathered at this stage"
" For example, online research 
communities can be used to identify consumer needs that are not being met and to 
brainstorm possible solutions"
 Further quantitative research can investigate what proportion of consumers share these problems and which potential solutions best meet those needs
"
3"
4
"3 Quantitative and qualitative data
 
Data can be classified as qualitative or quantitative"
" Qualitative research is exploratory and seeks to find out what potential consumers think and feel about 
a given subject"
" Qualitative research aids in identifying potential hypotheses, 
whereas quantitative research puts hard numbers behind these hypotheses"
 Quantitative research relies on numerical data to demonstrate statistically significant outcomes
"
The Internet can be used to gather both qualitative and quantitative data"
" In fact, 
the communities on the web can be viewed as large focus groups, regularly and 
willingly sharing their opinions on products, markets and companies"
" 
When both qualitative and quantitative research are used, qualitative research 
usually takes place first to get an idea of the issues to be aware of, and then quantitative research tests the theories put forward"
"
The main differences between quantitative and qualitative research are represented 
in the following table"
"
Quantitative Qualitative
Data gathered Numbers, figures, statistics, 
objective dataOpinions, feelings, motivations, subjective data

Group size Large Small
Data sources Surveys, web analytics data Focus groups, social mediaMarket Research  ›  Key concepts in market research
NOTE
With larger sample 
sizes, qualitative 
data may be analysed 
quantitatively"
""
"48 49Conducting surveys online allows for data to be captured immediately, and data 
analysis can be performed easily and quickly"
" By using email or the Internet for 
conducting surveys, geographical limitations for collecting data can be overcome 
cost effectively"
"
Technology allows you to compile sophisticated and user-friendly surveys"
" For 
example, as opposed to indicating impressions on a sliding scale, respondents can indicate emotional response"
" Or the survey can be tailored depending on 
previous answers (such as questions being skipped if they are not relevant to the 
respondent)"
"
You can run ongoing online surveys at minimal cost"
" Simple polls can be used in 
forums and on blogs to generate regular feedback"
" Website satisfaction surveys are also an easy way to determine the effectiveness of a website or marketing 
campaign"
"
A growing survey trend is getting instant feedback on questions or ideas from 
an existing community (such as a trusted group of thought leaders, your brand’s 
social media fans, or a pre-created research community)"
 Examples include the many Facebook polling apps and real-time mobile survey platforms such as InstantAfrica (www
instantafrica
com)
" 
Designing surveys 
How you design a survey and its questions will directly impact on your success"
" A survey can include any number and type of questions, and more complicated 
questions should appear only once users are comfortable with the survey"
"
Be careful that you do not introduce bias when creating questions by asking 
leading questions"
"
Example:    
Incorrect: We have recently introduced new features on the website to 
become a first class web destination"
" What are your thoughts on the new site? 
Replace with: What are your thoughts on the changes to the website?
In general, you will also find that you get more accurate answers when phrasing 
questions in the past tense than in the continuous tense"
"
Example:
Incorrect: How many times a week do you buy take-away food?
Replace with: In the past month, how many times did you buy take-away food?Market Research  ›  Online research methodologies
Because quantitative research aims to produce predictors for the total population, 
sample size is very important"
" The sample size needs to be sufficient in order to 
make statistically accurate observations about the population"
"
For example, if you have 4 000 registered users of your website, you don’t need to 
survey all of them in order to understand how the entire population behaves"
" You 
need to survey only 351 users to get a sample size that gives you a 95% confidence level with a ±5% confidence interval"
" This means that you can be 95% sure your 
results are accurate within ±5%"
"
There are several sample size calculators mentioned in the section on Tools of the 
trade"

"5 Online research methodologies
 
There are many online market research methodologies"
" This chapter touches on 
three of the most popular and useful ones: surveys, online focus groups and social 
media monitoring"
"
Which methodology should you choose?
That all depends on a variety of factors, from your research question and purpose 
to your budget and time"
" Here are some general pointers:
• Surveys: Ideal for collecting large amounts of quantitative data (and 
some qualitative data, too) – they are quick and easy to set up, and can 
run automatically"
"
• Online focus groups: Ideal for engaging consumers and collecting qualitative data such as opinions, ideas and feelings about the brand – they require a larger time investment and a willing group of participants"
"
• Online monitoring: Ideal for collecting qualitative data on brand sentiment, and can also provide some quantitative data around volume 
of interest in the brand – these data can be collected passively, and there 
are several tools that can automate this"
"

"1 Surveys
 
Surveys are questionnaires that contain a series of questions around a specific topic"
" Their purpose is to gather large volumes of quantitative data easily, though 
they can also collect some qualitative data"
"Market Research  ›  Key concepts in market research

Who would you select to 
participate in an online 
focus group? How do you 
think the demographic 
of your participants 
affect the resulting 
data?"

" Ranked or ordinal 
These questions ask respondents to rank items in order of preference or 
relevance"
 Respondents are given a numeric scale to indicate order
" This results 
in quantitative data"

"2 Focus groups
 
Online focus groups involve respondents gathering online and reacting to a 
particular topic"
" Respondents can be sourced from all over the world and react in 
real time, arguably being freer with their responses since they can be anonymous 
in an electronic environment"
"
Online focus groups are ideal for having frank, detailed conversations with people 
who have an interest in your brand – this means they result in primary, qualitative data"
 This information can then be used to create quantitative research questions
"Market Research  ›  Online research methodologies
Questions in the survey should be brief, easy to understand and easy to answer"
"
Types of survey questions
1"
" Open-ended 
Open-ended questions allow respondents to answer in their own words"
 This usually results in qualitative data
"
Example:
What features would you like to see on the website for the digital marketing 
textbook (www"
quirk
"biz/digital marketingtextbook)?
2"
" Closed
These questions give respondents specific responses from which to choose"
" These are typically multiple-choice questions with either one or multiple possible 
answers"
 This results in quantitative data
"
Example:
Do you use the digital marketing textbook website? 
Yes
No
or:
What features of the digital marketing textbook website do you use? Tick all 
that apply"

52 53participants discuss their impressions
" Usually running for between one and two 
hours, focus groups are used to get consumer views on:
• New products or marketing campaigns
• Existing products and campaigns, and how they can be improved
• Sentiment around the brand
• Views on a brand’s new direction or visual style
• Ideas for how the brand could improve its position or branding"
"
Online focus groups are excellent for collecting a lot of qualitative data quickly"
" When setting up the group, try to include enough participants to keep the conversation alive, but not too many so that some get drowned out by others – 
eight to ten is a good range"
" Also consider that you may run into technical troubles 
if people are connecting from different locations and Internet connections – be prepared to do some basic troubleshooting if this happens"
"
There are a number of different ways that you can recruit participants for an 
online focus group"
" This could include inviting people from your existing customer 
database, going through a traditional market research recruiting agent, or putting 
a call out on your website or social media communities"
" It is common practice to offer a small incentive to people who participate in a focus group, as it is a fairly 
time-intensive activity"
"

"3 Online monitoring
 
Finding out if people are talking about you is quite difficult in the offline world, 
but almost effortless online"
" Rather than having to conduct real-world surveys 
and interviews, in the digital world you can simply ‘listen’ to the conversation 
happening about you"
"
Keywords – the foundation to categorising and indexing the web – make it simple 
to track conversations taking place online"
" Customers don’t always use channels designated by a company to talk about that organisation, but the good news is that 
the Internet makes it easy for a company to identify and use the channels that 
customers have selected"
"
Online tools allow a company to track mentions of itself, its staff, its products, its 
industry and its competitors – or anything else that is relevant"
 This is called online monitoring or online listening – you are simply using digital tools to find and tap in to existing conversations
" The tool then gathers and collates all the mentions it finds, so that you can analyse the data for insights"
"Market Research  ›  Online research methodologies
Online focus groups can be conducted by using a range of technologies"
" The simplest is to use a text-based messaging program or online forum – there 
are many options available"
" More sophisticated tools allow for voice or video 
conferencing, and can make it easier for the researcher to pick up clues form the respondent’s voice and facial expressions"
" Some tools allow the researcher to share their desktop screen with respondents in order to illustrate a concept or 
question"
"

questions to ask, but the conversation usually grows and develops organically as

NOTE
Online reputation 
management involves much more than just handling a PR crisis"
 Online monitoring can supply your business with insight into the reception of many different business functions
 
"54 55Combinations of these four types of searches (operators) can be used to improve 
accuracy"
" 
•	 For example:  “Apple Computers” +”steve jobs” –fruit"
"
Applying this theory to the groupings above, some keywords used for Apple might be:
 
Company
•	 “Apple computers”
•	 “www"
apple
"com”
•	 Apple +Macbook, “iPod nano”, “Macbook Air”, “iTunes” +music –radio
•	 “Steve Jobs”
Industry
•	 “Consumer Electronics Show” +“Las Vegas”
•	 “CEBIT”
Competitors
•	 Microsoft
•	 www"
microsoft
"com
 
It is also important to track common misspellings, all related companies and all related websites"
"
Tracking the names of people key to a company can highlight potential brand 
attacks, or can demonstrate new areas of outreach for a company"
"
Brand names, employee names, product names and even competitor names are 
not unique"
" To save yourself from monitoring too much, identify keywords that will 
indicate that a post has nothing to do with your company, and exclude those in your searches"
"
For example, “apple” could refer to a consumer electronics company, or it could 
appear in a post about the health benefits of fruit"
" Finding keywords that will 
indicate context can help to save time"
" So, you could exclusive-match words such 
as “fruit”, “tasty” and “granny smith”"
"
Tools for online monitoring
Thankfully, online listening does not entail hourly searches on your favourite search engine to see what conversations are taking place online"
" There are many 
different tools that monitor the web, and supply the results via email alerts or RSS 
feeds or a web dashboard"
" Market Research  ›  Online research methodologies
Typically, searches include the following main focus areas:
• Company
• Brand name
• Key products
• Key personnel (names, job titles, etc"
")
• Key campaigns and activities
• Industry
• Conferences
• Patents
• News
• Competitors
• Brand names
• Product launches
• Website updates
• Job vacancies
• Key people
There are four different types of searches you can perform to track relevant brand 
keywords"
" Each modifies the specific type of data collected and aims to improve 
the quality and depth of the data you gather"
"
The four operators are:
• Broad match – e"
g
  Apple Computers
" This is when any of or all words 
must be found in the mention"
"
• Direct match – e"
g
 “Apple Computers”
" This is denoted by quotation 
marks and dictates that the tool should find mentions only where the phrase appears complete and in order in the content"
"
• Inclusive match – e"
g
 Apple +computers
 This is denoted by a plus sign directly before a word or phrase
" This will direct the tool to search for 
any mention that contains both Apple AND computers, although not 
necessarily in that order"
"
• Exclusive match – e"
g
 Apple –fruit
 This is denoted by a minus sign directly before a word or phrase
" This will instruct the tool to include only mentions that contain the first word or phrase but not when the second 
word is also in the same mention"

"4 Other avenues for online research
Personal interviews
There are various tools available to the online researcher for conducting personal 
interviews, such as private chat rooms or video calling"
" The Internet can connect 
a researcher with many people around the world and make it possible to conduct 
interviews with more anonymity, should respondents require it"
" 
Observation/Online ethnography
Taking its cue from offline ethnography, online ethnography requires researchers to immerse themselves in a particular environment"
" In this way insights can be 
gathered that might not have been attainable from a direct interview"
" However, 
they do depend more heavily on the ethnographer’s interpretation, and are therefore subjective"
" 
Online research communities
Although online communities are a valuable resource for secondary research, communities can also provide primary data"
" General Motors’ Fast Lane blog is an 
example of an online research community that helps gather research data"
" The 
blog can be used as a means to elicit feedback to a particular research problem"
 This is qualitative data that can aid the company in exploring their research problem further
" In many cases, social media can be used to gather insight about 
a brand or customer experience"
" It is important to remember, however, that a 
representative sample is necessary for making solid conclusions"
" 
Listening labs
When developing websites and online applications, usability testing is a vital process that will ensure the website or application is able to meet consumers’ 
needs"
" Listening labs involve setting up a testing environment where a consumer 
is observed using a website or application"
"
Conversion optimisation
Conversion optimisation aims to determine the factors of an advert, website or web page that can be improved in order to convert customers more effectively"
" 
From search adverts to email subject lines and shopping cart design, tests can be 
set up to determine what variables are affecting the conversion rate"

"6 Room for error
 
With all research, there is a given amount of error to deal with"
" Bias may arise during 
surveys and focus groups (for example, interviewers leading the respondents) or 
be present in the design and wording of the questions themselves"
" There could 
be sample errors or respondent errors"
 Using the Internet to administer surveys removes the bias that may arise from an interviewer
" However, with no interviewer to explain questions, there is potential for greater respondent error"
" This is why survey design is so important, and why it is crucial to test and run pilots of the 
survey before going live"
"
Respondent errors also arise when respondents become too familiar with the 
survey process"
 The general industry standard is to limit respondents to being interviewed once every six months
"
Sample error is a fact of market research"
" Some people are just not interested, 
nor will they ever be interested, in taking part in research"
" Are these people fundamentally different from those who do? Is there a way of finding out? To some 
extent, web analytics, which track the behaviour of all visitors to your website, can 
be useful in determining this"
"
When conducting online research, it is crucial to understand who is in the target 
market, and what the best way to reach that target market is"
 Web surveys can exclude groups of people due to access or ability
" It is vital to determine if is this is 
acceptable to the survey, and to use other means of capturing data if not"

"6 Justifying the cost of research
 
Regular research is an important part of any business’ growth strategy, but it 
can be tough to justify the budget necessary for research without knowing the 
benefit"
" Conducting research can cost little more than an employee’s work hours, 
depending on his or her skills, or it can be an expensive exercise involving external experts"
" Deciding where your business needs are on the investment scale depends on the depth of the research required, and what the expected growth will be for the 
business"
" When embarking on a research initiative, the cost to benefit ratio should 
be determined"
"
Testing should be an ongoing feature of any digital marketing activity"
" Tracking is 
a characteristic of most digital marketing, which allows for constant testing of the 
most basic hypothesis: is this campaign successful in reaching the goals of the 
business?Market Research  ›  Justifying the cost of research
The Conversion Optimisation chapter covers tools for running tests, such as A/B 
split testing and multivariate testing"

"5 How to get responses: Incentives and assurances
 
As the researcher, you know what’s in it for you when sending out a survey: you will receive valuable insights that will aid in making business decisions"
" But what 
is in it for the respondents?
According to Survey Monkey, the ways in which the surveys are administered play 
a role in response rates, and these can be relative: 
Mail: 50% adequate, 60–70% good to very good 
Phone: 80% good 
Email: 40% average, 50–60% good to very good Online: 30% averageClassroom pager: 50+% goodFace to face: 80–85% good
(University of Texas, 2011)
Response rates can be improved by offering respondents an incentive for 
participating in the research, such as a chance to win a grand prize, a discount or 
special offer for every respondent, or even the knowledge that they are improving a product or service that they care about"
"
Some researchers feel that monetary incentives are not always a good thing"
" Some 
respondents may feel that they need to give ‘good’ or ‘correct’ answers that may 
bias your results"
" Alternatively, you may attract respondents who are in it just for 
the reward"
" One approach could be to run the survey with no incentive, with the option of offering one if responses are limited"
"  
Designing the survey to assure respondents of the minimal time commitment and 
their privacy can also help to increase responses"

this in the Conversion 
Optimisation chapter"

Understanding the 
limitations of your research design is crucial to delivering useful results"

"8 Advantages and challenges
 
Market researchers are increasingly turning to online tools in their research 
processes"
" The Internet allows for research at a far lower cost; it can also more 
easily cross geographic boundaries and can speed up the research process"
" 
This is not to say there are not downsides"
" While the Internet makes it possible to 
reach a far larger group of people without the cost of facilitators, this does come 
with some challenges"
" For example, you cannot control the environments in which information is being gathered"
" For an online sample, it’s important to focus on 
getting the correct number of people to make your study statistically viable"
" If your 
questions are not carefully drafted, confusing questions could lead to answers that are flawed or not relevant"
" Additionally, online incentives could lead to answers that are not truthful, meaning that the value of the data could be questionable"
" 
The value of Internet research should by no means be discounted, but it is 
important to consider the nature of the study carefully, and interrogate the validity 
and legitimacy of the data as a valid representation"
"  Data is meaningful only if it is representative, so make sure to establish goals and realistic expectations for your research"

"2 The problem
 
Rocking the Daisies is a South African-born music festival that takes place every October in Darling in the Western Cape"
" For festival organisers, measuring the success of the event is crucial to the 
planning process for the next one"
" They ask questions such as: ‘How do we prove that the event is 
increasing in popularity?’, and ‘How do we prove that this year’s festival is more successful than last year’s?’
The problem is that measurement of sponsored events is challenging, as attendees are often 
unwilling to interrupt their experience to respond to research questionnaires, and research 
conducted after the experience loses its impetus and accuracy"

that their announcement of an international band headlining the festival caused huge excitement

In 2011, the top themes of conversation had revolved around the party atmosphere of the festival,

"3 The solution
 
Enter BrandsEye, an online monitoring tool that captures organic conversations in real time 
across multiple online platforms, offering insight for both organisers and sponsors"
" BrandsEye 
also offers a range of metrics used to track festival performance"
"
For two consecutive years, event organisers have used BrandsEye to track online conversation 
before, during and after the festival"
" As a result, they can understand the festival audience’s needs 
and preferences, garner insights in order to answer the most pressing questions around the festival’s success, identify new commercial opportunities, and assist in assessing ROI for sponsors"
" 
For a festival this large, online conversation across social media, blogs, forums, press and various 
other platforms begins six months (or more) before the event"
" For the 2012 festival, BrandsEye began its tracking around May, and slowly watched the volumes of online conversation increase 
as the festival approached"
"
All data collected during the period was processed and displayed on BrandsEye’s customised 
measurement dashboards, which automatically updated in real time"
" Additionally, users could 
apply filters to explore the data and mine them for insights"

"
The high level of Interest from the press demonstrates the popularity of the event"
" When it comes 
to proving a return on investment (ROI) to sponsors, Rocking the Daisies was able to monitor 
usage of the sponsor names in connection with the festival"
" BrandsEye tracked these keywords 
and was able to rank the sponsors by who was mentioned most frequently online"
" 
The most frequently mentioned sponsors were the ones whose names were displayed on a stage"
" 
Furthermore, sponsors with favourable branding and signage gained additional exposure through online conversation"
" 
Lastly, certain conversation trends have enabled organisers to identify opportunities for specialist 
sponsors based on attendees’ complaints and desires"
" At future events, sponsorship deals with 
car wash products and flu remedies (for example) could simultaneously benefit concertgoers, organisers and sponsors"
" 
Based on these insights, BrandsEye could offer Rocking the Daisies three valuable 
recommendations:
1"
" Since the response was so large and positive, Rocking the Daisies should plan to introduce more international content at future festivals, based on the hype it creates"
"
2"
" Because of the high demand and buzz around tickets, Rocking the Daisies organisers 
could substantiate an increase in sponsorship and ticket fees in the long term"
"
3"
" Since branded stages in particular provided a higher ROI, organisers could increase 
the costs of sponsorship packages or facilitate bidding for these positions, thereby increasing sponsorship revenue accordingly"

" It helps 
you find your audiences on social channels by indicating where they spend most of their time, and how they like interacting with your brand"
" It also helps you meet their needs by defining the touchpoints they expect from your brand, especially when it comes to creating web and mobile 
channels"

"3 Defining Content marketing
 
Content marketing is an umbrella term, one which focuses on matching content 
(information or entertainment) to your customer needs at whichever stage they are 
in the buying cycle or customer journey"
" Unlike TV, where the advertiser pushes 
messages to a captive audience, the focus is on engaging content, which means that marketers must think like publishers (attracting an audience) rather than seeing themselves as advertisers (buying an audience) of a product"
" The Internet 
has, in many respects, cut out the middle man"
" Consumers and brands can now 
connect directly through a number of easily accessible online platforms"
"
The Content Marketing Institute offers the following definition:
Content marketing is a marketing technique of creating and distributing relevant and 
valuable content to attract, acquire, and engage a clearly defined and understood target audience – with the objective of driving profitable customer action (Content 
Marketing Institute, 2013)"
"
This definition applies to all the spaces in which you share content – your website, 
campaigns and competitions, a company blog or the social media space – as well 
as the way in which that information is shared"
" 
Kristina Halvorson suggests the model illustrated below for approaching the 
different areas of content marketing strategy"

"1 Introduction
 
While the phrase ‘content is king’ has been referenced for some time, it is only in the 
recent few years that Content Marketing Strategy has been solidified into a discipline 
of its own"
" Defining content marketing strategy can be tricky, however, with some 
practitioners focusing more on the role it plays in information architecture and others believing that it should be considered on a campaign by campaign basis"
" This chapter looks at content marketing strategy from a holistic perspective, as a process 
that includes an understanding of all the content your brand is creating, those for 
whom it is intended, and to what purpose"
" There is a need to understand the brand and consumer context and match these to the best route to customer (in terms of 
tactics)"
" Ultimately this supports the design of communication that impacts people 
enough to make them want to share the content on"
" 
In this chapter, you will learn:
• To understand the role of content marketing strategy within your marketing plan
• To be familiar with the steps involved in developing your content marketing 
strategy
• To recognise some models for understanding how types of content are 
absorbed or experienced by your target audience"

AlgorithmAn algorithm is a mathematical, computational or statistical 
method pre-determined to take a number of variables into account and output a single, quantifiable result that is a function of all the variables"
 A good example of a commonly used algorithm is the one used by Google to determine which pages rank more highly on SERPs

"2 Market research and consumer personas
 
The sweet spot for content marketing lies in an intercept between the marketing goals of a brand, the brand personality as it guides and differentiates that brand in 
the marketplace, and the consumer motivation for paying any attention to a brand 
at all"
 One device that is used in addressing consumer needs is the development of a consumer persona
" 
A persona is a profile that a writer creates to embody the characteristics of the 
target audience for whom he or she is writing"
" 
Personas are based on the profile of users of your content"
" Creating a profile is all 
about considering the characteristics of your readers and their needs and desires"
" 
It’s important to focus on the motivations of the persona that you may create, 
rather than exterior signifiers that lead to the creation of a stereotype"
" The persona assists you in segmenting and understanding your target market and is a 
framework through which you can guide any content that you create"
"

"3 Creating content pillars
 
Linked to the brand identity are certain themes, which could also be called content 
pillars"
" These are areas of focus that support the creation of content that match 
to a consumer’s interest"
" These themes must be true to the brand essence, not 
focused directly on sales, and should also speak to the interests of the audience"
" 
Content Marketing Strategy  ›  Strategic building blocks
Content components
• Substance: Who are you trying to reach, and why?
• Structure: Where is your content? How is it organised? How do people find your content?
People components
• Workflow: How does your content happen?
• Governance: Politics, guidelines and standards (Halvorson, 2010)"
"
As you can see in the above discussion, Halvorson suggests that one consider the bigger picture of content creation rather than just the product which is the 
end result"
" Content marketing looks at staff, tools, processes and outcomes"
" The 
end goal for these processes is, as outlined in the Content Marketing Institute definition, the delivery of a “profitable customer action”"
 All content should be created with a strategic outcome in mind

"1 Translating your brand essence
 
The brand essence is a sentence which sums up the unique attributes of a brand and the basis for its emotional connection with customers"
" Your brand essence 
should assist in defining a tone of voice for your brand and the style in which it 
engages with its customers"
 The brand essence can be a useful guide for ensuring that the content you create (and your marketing activity) represents the brand appropriately
 Some relate this to your brand story
" What is your reason for being, 
and how do you connect that with the interests of your customers? 
Will it Blend? is a video series by Blendtec which builds on this principle"
" Blendtec

" Their value proposition is that they can blend anything, and their very popular videos demonstrate this"

Information can be presented through any number of mediums, which is both an opportunity and a challenge faced by content marketers"
" Digital distribution allows 
for videos, images, interactive infographics and any number of other formats"
" To 
gain and keep the attention of consumers/users, it’s sometimes not enough to 
rely simply on text-based forms of content"

select the right medium based on overall objectives, production capabilities, and the needs of the audience"

"  Content pillars can be considered in line with the brand’s essence, and 
then situated within the context of the reader "
" 
For Coca-Cola, for example, consumer interests filtered through the brand 
essence of ‘Coke brings joy’ could result in the following pillars: 
• Friendship
• Sharing is caring
• Spreading smiles"
"
These pillars are then used as the basis on which to develop content ideas"
" 
Figure 4"
" Coca-Cola express their brand essence in all of their communications, as 
demonstrated in the Tweet above"
" 
In the above tweet, we can see how a particular content pillar was translated 
into a question that is focused on relationships and family"
 It also encourages engagement from the audience by asking for their input
" 
Another example which demonstrates this is how Corona brought their brand 
essence to life through an interactive documentary"
" The documentary depicted the 
first encounter that people from Bulin in China, 7 500km from the coast, had with the beach"

"5 The content audit
 
Once you have established your marketing goals, your brand personality and a guiding understanding of who you are trying to reach, the content audit is a 
sometimes laborious but necessary next step"
" The content audit involves an audit 
of all the existing content supplied by the brand – the website, white papers, articles, videos and content shared on social media sites can all be considered"
" An assessment can then be made of how well these pieces of content match the 
strategic needs of the brand and its audience"
" 
While you can either thoroughly immerse yourself in this process or attempt to get 
a more time-efficient overview, the goal is to map what is currently on offer with what is necessary in mind"
" It is important not just to understand what you have, but also how it is currently organised and accessed by your audience"
" 
Many practitioners suggest the use of a spreadsheet to achieve this"
" Content can 
be found to be either mismatched to the goals of the organisation, or spot on"
" Most

" Are your customer needs being addressed? Where do the opportunities lie?Content Marketing Strategy  ›  Strategic building blocks
As discussed in the Digital Marketing Strategy chapter, determining your objectives is an essential part of your marketing planning, and should feed into your content 
marketing strategy"
" Understanding the journey your consumers go through as 
they approach your ultimate sales goal will enable you to match content formats to their needs"
 A humorous video may be successful in initially making potential customers aware of your brand
" Once you have their attention, however, a research 
paper or useful case study could be more effective in convincing them that you are 
the best choice in the market"
" 
There are many examples of online journalism using multimedia to convey 
information most effectively to their readers"
" The New York Times has presented a number of different methods for conveying complex information in an engaging 
manner"
 ‘Snow Fall’ by John Branch is one example (http://www
nytimes
"com/
projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek)"
"

The New York Times also often publishes infographics that demonstrate this 
principle powerfully"

" An always-on-content strategy approach builds relationships and 
engagement"
"
By constantly engaging with audiences, something which is well suited to social 
media, for example, it is possible to build and maintain a relationship with 
customers/readers"
" Consider the image above, where constant engagement 
builds on the peaks of engagement that shorter term campaigns can offer"

"4 Content models
 
Your organisation’s content requirements and objectives should determine the structure of your content teams"
" Do you have a need for ongoing content creation, 
or are there less frequent high-input forms of content that will benefit your 
organisation? There are many models which are constantly evolving, so do invest in some research around what will suit your organisation"
 We have outlined two approaches below
"
Stock and flow 
Stock content refers to bigger, beautiful assets that require more investment and age well, meaning that they will be interesting in six months as well as today"
" ‘The 
Dewarists’, by Dewars, is an example of this"
" A high-production value TV show 
was created and sponsored by the brand in order to achieve awareness across its target market"

"1 Learning from publishers
 
The term brand as publisher refers to repositioning the function of the marketer or brand manager"
" Rather than focusing on the immediate sale or conversion, a 
publisher focuses on value and interest for the reader, and building a relationship 
based on supplying information or entertainment that suits the customer’s needs"
 Makeup
"com by L ’Oreal is an oft-cited example of a brand publishing useful tips and content that does not link to a product or sales directly, but demonstrates how 
the brand can give consumers the lifestyle they desire"
"

"2 Resource planning – thinking like a publisher
 
Content marketing touches on a number of departments in an organisation"
" 
Marketing, sales, customer service, corporate communications, human resources 
and website management teams should all be aware of the content marketing 
strategy for a business"
 Co-ordinating content between these teams can be challenging if not impossible if turnaround times are tight
" This is why it is important not only to look at where content production should live in your organisation, but 
also to map the workflow of content creation, an essential function"
" Are designers 
involved? Where does quality control take place? Where can a piece of content be adapted and reused on a different distribution channel?
Some organisations opt to have a central role for someone who oversees content; 
others build in-house departments"
" Whether you are outsourcing to a publishing 
house, or training a team in house, the decision must be made and planned for so 
that workflow can be mapped in order to facilitate your strategic needs"
" 
4"
5
"3 Always on content planning
 
Given that a large part of the global population is constantly engaging with content via various digital devices and platforms, it is necessary to consider content 
creation in terms of not only short campaign bursts, but ongoing delivery and 
engagement"
 Consider the illustration below
" Content Marketing Strategy  ›  Content creation
Relationships"

"6 Content channel distribution

"1 Algorithmic curation
 
Algorithmic curation is a term that refers to the algorithms platforms have created 
for dealing with information overload"
" Various platforms, like Facebook and the 
search engine Google, use algorithms to filter out the amount of information that 
is delivered to users"
" Each algorithm will use a number of factors to determine what is actually relevant and interesting to the person doing a search, or looking at their news feed"
" One of the factors that influences whether a piece of content is 
considered relevant is how much an individual engages with the brand’s presence 
on that platform over time"
" Posts shared by a Facebook page, for example, may reach only users who have previously engaged with posts from that page through 
commenting or liking"
" It is therefore important to create content that encourages 
engagement and sharing"
" 
4"
6
"2 Understanding your channels
 
Understanding the channels through which you share content is as important as the crafting of that content itself"
" Reaching people effectively will only be 
achieved if the medium supports the message and vice versa"
" Social media, email 
marketing, mobile marketing and video marketing are just some disciplines that will form part of your content creation arsenal"
" The rest of this book is dedicated to best practice in communicating effectively through the various digital disciplines 
available to you"
" 
4"
"7 Tools of the trade
 
In order to support the ongoing production of interesting content, it is necessary to 
have some planning documents in place"
 Consider those outlined below
" 
• Brand style guides
This document guides anyone creating content for a brand at any time"
" What is the tone of voice and brand personality? How is it best 
represented visually, and what are the brand colours and fonts? This 
can be a challenging document to put together, and it usually isn’t the content marketer who is tasked with doing so, but is essential to aligning brand communications"
" It is also a document that tends to be ‘live’ – it is 
constantly updated as the brand and content landscapes evolve and new 
conventions need to come into play"
"Content Marketing Strategy  ›  Tools of the trade
Figure 10"
" ‘The Dewarists’ was a TV show sponsored by alcohol brand, Dewars"
"
Flow content has a lower production value and a quicker production and publishing 
time frame"
" Images depicting what is going on at a business on any given day, for example, freshly baked goods at a bakery, can be placed in this category"
"
Figure 11"
" Cake Boss posts images depicting their preparations on their 
 
Facebook page"
"
Both types of content should be considered for balancing out a content strategy"
" 
Destination and distributed thinking
It can also be useful to consider destination and distributed content"
" Content which 
you are either sending out to the world through various platforms and networks, or which pulls your reader towards a page on your website or an article on your 
blog"
" Rather than focusing solely on driving readers to your owned media spaces, 
such as your website, consider how to create content that engages with your target audience in the spaces where they are active"
" 
Content Marketing Strategy  ›  Content creation"
"82 83One of the more powerful benefits, however, is that you can learn a lot about your 
target consumer through the content with which they do or do not engage"
" The 
more targeted and ongoing your content, the more data you can gather about how 
effectively you are reaching those you need to"
" 
One of the great challenges in content marketing is providing content that is truly 
interesting and engaging to the right people – the right mix of subject matter and brand"
" Matching content to the required outcome for your strategic purposes takes 
dedication and focus"
" In the context of ongoing content production, it can also be a 
challenge to maintain levels of quality over time, which is why process and quality assurance steps must be put in place"
" Consider that the goal is not to create as much content as possible, rather it is to focus on relevance and content that matches 
strategic outcomes"

"2 The problem
 
The Coca-Cola Company is a global beverage producer"
" Even though the brand is globally known 
and extremely successful, it has set its sights on doubling its business by 2020"
" It also noted two 
key changes in the market: consumers were creating an ever-increasing amount of brand content, 
and technology had empowered them as never before to shape the brand"
"
Coca-Cola decided that it needed to harness the power of content marketing in order to engage 
consumers"
"
4"
9
"3 The solution
 
In order to meet their goal of doubling the size of their business by 2020, Coca-Cola created a multifaceted content strategy based on two key content pillars: liquid and linked"
"
‘Liquid’ embodies the notion that our networked and connected world enables ideas to spread 
rapidly – liquid ideas are those that capture the imagination and cannot be controlled once they 
are put out in the world"
" 
While liquid ideas are creative, they are grounded in a linked strategy"
" ‘Linked’ makes sure that 
ideas are always centred on the core brand story and experience – in other words, liquid ideas 
must reflect positively on the Coca-Cola brand"
" It also means that all the brand channels should 
be coherent and unified"
"Content Marketing Strategy  ›  Case study – Coca-Cola Company
• Content calendars
Content calendars assist the content marketer in planning the content they will be sharing, across which platforms, and when"
" The more 
advance planning is undertaken, the easier it is to react quickly to tactical 
opportunities"
" 
• Workflow map
A workflow map documents the path a piece of content takes when it is created"
" What are the steps in approval, how is it optimised for digital 
publishing, who has final sign off? Is it a duplicate of existing content, and 
where else can it be used? A workflow map assists you in streamlining this process"
"

"10 The bigger picture
 
Content is a significant component of many digital marketing disciplines"
" When creating content, 
you should always keep the principles of writing for the web in mind"
"
• Email marketing relies on great content – since most people suffer from email fatigue, they 
will only stop to read emails that they know are of high quality and that provide excellent 
content"
"
• Social media marketing also depends on sharing relevant and valuable content with social 
fans"
" While your brand promise may get them to your social page, your ongoing stream of 
quality content will encourage them to interact and share, spreading the word about your company"
" 
• Search engine optimisation is strongly influenced by the quality, frequency and value of 
content"
" Not only will search engines favour your site, but others will choose to link in to your content, creating a valuable referrer for your brand"
"
• Video marketing is a whole new approach to content, in which you create dynamic and 
shareable videos specifically tailored to the interests and needs of your audience"
"
• Mobile marketing also requires that you consider the unique requirements of your audiences 
across a series of devices"
" If you understand the role that each device plays in a user’s life and buying cycle, you can tailor content to optimally address their needs"
" 
 
4"
"11 Summary
 
Content marketing presents a pull mechanism for the marketer rather than a push one"
" Brands must consider their brand identity and the market they are trying to reach in order to create 
targeted and valuable brand content that delivers on strategic objectives"
" 
It’s about more than creating a piece of content – content marketing strategy looks at how you 
structure your organisation to create that content, and how you match specific types of content and 
methods of delivery for achieving strategic outcomes"
" 
These ideas need to resonate with people rather than simply existing across an array of media 
with which they are presented"

"4 The outcome
 
Rather than focusing on traditional advertising, Coca-Cola has thrown its weight behind a global content strategy to meet its rather ambitious goals"
" It identified that audiences are now largely in 
control of the brand, and that it is more important to have an open conversation with them than to 
broadcast advertising at them"
" 
Coca-Cola’s content marketing plan is based on three core elements:
1"
" Storytelling: As part of the liquid principle, Coca-Cola has recognised the power of 
storytelling"
" Stories create an emotional connection, connect people and spread ideas, 
which leads to conversations"
" In dynamic storytelling, a brand idea is released to the 
audience and picked up in various conversations and channels"
" One of Coca-Cola’s key brand stories is ‘living positively’ and showing how the brand makes the world a better 
place"
" This content idea also forms part of the company values, showing the importance of 
aligning business and content objectives"
 Each sub-brand has a big-picture content plan that outlines key elements of the story and how they will be disseminated
" 
2"
" Consumer-generated content: Consumer-generated content forms a cornerstone of the 
content strategy"
" Brand stories encourage consumer reactions and engagement (and are 
often created by the consumers themselves)"
" The worldwide distribution of creativity and 
technology means that consumers have greater power than ever before to create and drive brand stories, which leads to emotional connections"
 Coca-Cola actively encourages fans to ‘act and react’ to the stories
"
3"
" Unified brand experience: Finally, Coca-Cola puts a lot of emphasis on creating a unified, 
coherent and accessible brand experience"
" While there are many stories to be told about the brand, it is still necessary to filter and edit these to ensure that they speak to the brand’s key values"
" By focusing on content excellence, Coca-Cola is creating value and engagement, not merely noise"
" Maintaining this means that the brand must communicate 
effectively with staff around the world"
"
In keeping with the ‘linked’ principle, these ideas will always be linked to business data and 
business objectives to solve problems (TheCognitiveMedia, n"
d
)
" 
Content on the web will spread regardless of whether a brand is involved or not – but Coca-Cola 
has picked up that they can steer the story themselves"
" By engaging proactively, building powerful, 
viral brand stories and giving consumers some control over how the brand is expressed, they are 
able to steer the conversation to their benefit – this is the true power of content marketing"

"90Introduction to Create
Research, planning and strategy lay the foundation for building successful digital 
assets – such as websites, mobile sites, web and social media applications, videos 
and even simple landing pages"
" In the next few chapters, we detail how to create 
some of these digital assets"
"
One of the biggest challenges is creating assets that make the most of rapidly 
evolving technology, while remaining accessible to the range of users in your market"
" In writing these chapters, we faced a similar challenge: technology is 
constantly in flux"
" Because of this, we have focused on principles for success"
" 
Creating digital assets is not a solitary job"
" There are many different teams of 
experts who work together to create something that will delight users"
" So, it stands to reason that there are many aspects to consider when looking at creating 
digital assets"
"
This is a book aimed at marketers, rather than developers and designers, but it is 
important that you also understand the opportunities and challenges of the web"
" 
This is a vast subject, but hopefully the next few chapters will leave you feeling 
equipped to ask the right questions when relying on others to get the job done 
 
for you"
"
We start by looking at User Experience Design – the process of creating 
remarkable, user-friendly and effective digital assets"
" The Web Development and Design chapter focuses on creating websites, but the principles apply to a range of digital assets and devices (with a dedicated section on mobile)"
" While we won’t 
teach you how to build a website yourself, we do equip you with what you need 
to know to manage and be involved in the process"
" Lastly, we look at Writing for Digital – after all, the words we read on the screen are often a vehicle for much of 
our online experience"
" All three of these practices work closely together when we 
create web assets"

"1 Introduction
Have you ever visited a website that was just plain confusing, with broken links, 
unintuitive navigation and long, rambling text? Or, conversely, have you had a web 
experience that just worked, where everything was clear, easy and even enjoyable 
to use? If so, you’ve encountered the extremes of user experience design"
 Excellent UX can delight and convert customers
" Conversely, bad UX can lead to lost revenue and less chance of repeat visitors"
"
User experience design is a web concept that is difficult to define specifically, 
since it’s often a case of ‘you’ll know it when you see it’"
" A standard website needs to be reliable, functional and convenient – but a great UX website needs to be 
enjoyable to use, and an experience worth sharing"
" What this means in practice 
for a specific website, company, audience or context can differ, but the principle remains the same – delivering a great experience to users, and making it easy 
for them to convert to your desired goal"
" UX is the first, foundational step of an 
effective digital asset"
" 
In this chapter, you will learn:
• To think about web projects with a UX mindset
• How to create usable, amazing and enjoyable experiences for desktop 
and mobile users
• The nuts and bolts of implementing UX strategy step by step
• About a variety of awesome UX tools"

"3 Understanding UX design
User experience (UX) can be defined as all the experiences (physical, sensory, 
emotional and mental) that a person has when interacting with a digital tool"
" 
The field of UX is full of similar-sounding jargon, so here’s a quick guide to the 
terms you should know"
"
User experience (UX) is the overall satisfaction a user gets from interacting 
with a product or digital tool"
" 
User experience design (UXD, sometimes UED) is the process of applying 
proven principles, techniques and features to a digital tool to create and optimise 
the user experience"
" 
User-centred design (UCD) is the design philosophy that prioritises the user’s 
needs and wants above all else, and places the user at the centre of the entire experience"
" This often entails research and testing with real users of the site or 
product"
"
User interface (UI) is the user-facing part of the tool or platform – the part of the 
actual website, application or tool that the user interacts with"
" 
Usability means how user friendly, efficient and slick the digital product is"
"
 
Online UX can be divided into two broad categories:
1"
 Functional UX
" This covers the elements of the user experience that 
relate to actually using the tool – such as working technical elements, 
navigation, search and links"
"
2"
 Creative UX
" This is the bigger, harder-to-define impression created 
by the tool – the so-called ‘wow’ factor that covers visual and creative 
elements"
"
There are six qualities that make up good UX:
• Findability – can I find it easily? Does it appear high up in the search 
results?
• Accessibility – can I use it when I need it? Does it work on my mobile 
phone, or on a slow Internet connection? Can I use it as a disabled person?• Desirability – do I want to use it? Is it a pleasant experience, or do I dread logging in?
• Usability – is it easy to use? Are the tools I need intuitive and easy to find?
• Credibility – do I trust it? Is this website legitimate?
• Usefulness – does it add value to me? Will I get something out of the time I spend interacting with it?

"1 The benefits of UX
There are some real, tangible benefits to applying UX design to digital marketing 
strategies"
"
Good UX is an excellent way to differentiate yourself in the market and give 
yourself a competitive advantage"
" If your online touchpoints are easy, fun, intuitive 
and awesome to use, your customers won’t have any reason to look elsewhere"
" 
Good UX research and design allows you to find the best solution for your needs"
" 
Every business, website and online service is unique in some way, which means 
that the way it is set up must be unique too"
"
Amazon’s $300 million button is perhaps the most dramatic example of how a 
simple UX fix can impact the business"
" Amazon managed to gain an extra $300 million worth of sales simply by changing their ‘Register’ button to one that 
read ‘Continue’ instead"
" The number of customers increased by 45% because they no longer felt they needed to go through an onerous registration process 
simply to fulfil a basic shopping action"
" In fact, nothing else about the purchase

Every marketer knows that the ideal customer is a happy customer"
" People who love the experience you give them will become loyal clients, and possibly even 
brand evangelists – people who will sing your praises far and wide"
" 
Applying UX principles means that you can get your digital tools working earlier, 
with much better functionality, at a lower cost"
" This is because you can cut out 
features and elements that you simply don’t need, and focus on the core user experience"
" This optimised development process leads, in turn, to sites that are easier and cheaper to maintain, upgrade and support across multiple platforms"

"4 Core principles of UX design

"1 User-centric design
While this may seem like the most obvious point, it’s surprising how often the 
user is forgotten in the user experience"
" Business owners, marketers and web 
developers frequently focus on creating the web platforms they want and think are 
best, instead of really interrogating what the user needs"
" Often, the performance of web assets is compromised when the design process is driven only by internal business needs (for instance, ensuring that each department in the company has 
a space that it controls on the home page) at the expense of what the user needs"
"
When designing for the user, you need to ask the following questions:
• Who is the user? 
• What are the user’s wants and needs from your platform?
• Why is the user really coming to your website?
• What are the user’s capabilities, web skills and available technology?
• What features would make the user’s experience easier and better?
The answers to these questions will come out of user research, as discussed in the 
Market Research chapter earlier in this book"
"
Figure 1"
 It’s essential to give users exactly what they need
 (Source: XKCD
"com)Of course, many users may not know exactly what their wants and needs are! It 
is the UX practitioner’s job to discover these through research and interpret them 
in the best way possible"
" Keep Henry Ford’s famous quote in mind here: “If I had 
asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses"
"”

"2 Usability and conventions
Usability is about making the digital assets we build easy and intuitive to use"
" To paraphrase Steve Krug, don’t make your users think: they should just do (Krug, 
1997-2013)"
"
One of the most important aspects of usability involves sticking to standard 
conventions, which are simply common rules or ways of displaying or structuring things on the web"
" Popular conventions include:
• Links that are blue and underlined
• Navigation menus at the top or left of the web page
• The logo in the top left hand corner, which is linked to take the user back 
to the home page
• Search boxes placed at the top of the page, using standard wording such 
as ‘search’, or a magnifying glass icon"
"
Ensure that all website elements (such as menus, logos, colours and layout) are distinct, easy to find and kept consistent throughout the site"
" 
There are some key ‘don’ts’ when it comes to building a user-friendly and usable 
website:
• Never resize windows or launch the site in a pop-up"
"
• Don’t use entry or splash pages (a page that site visitors encounter first 
before reaching the home page)"
"
• Never build a site entirely in Flash – most search engine spiders cannot effectively trawl Flash sites, and these will not work on many mobile devices"
"
• Don’t distract users with ‘Christmas trees’ (blinking images, flashing lights, automatic sound, scrolling text, unusual fonts, etc"
)
"
It’s useful to consider usability guidelines to ensure that your website is on track"
" 
MIT Information Services & Technology provides a usability checklist online at 
http://ist"

edu/usability 
"
NOTE
Can you think of any 
other web conventions? How have these evolved over time, and how important is it to stick to the rules?"

"3 Simplicity
In UX projects, the simpler option is almost always the better, more user-friendly 
one"
" Though your service or product may be complex, that doesn’t mean your 
customer-facing web portals need to be"
" In fact, it’s important to remember that 
most customers want only the most basic information from you, such as “What is this?” and “How does it work?”
Simplicity can mean several things:
• Lots of empty space"
" In design terms, this is referred to as negative 
or white space (though, of course, it need not specifically be white)"
" 
Dark text on a light background is easiest to read"
" In general, the more 
effectively ‘breathing room’ is placed between various page elements, 
lines of text, and zones of the page, the easier it is for the user to grasp where everything is"
"
• Fewer options"
" When users have to make choices, there is a lot of psychology at play – worry about making the right choice, confusion and 
doubt over the options, indecision paralysis and more"
" Studies have found 
that people faced with fewer choices generally choose more quickly and confidently, and are more satisfied with their decision afterwards (Roller, 
2010)"
" 
• Plain language"
" Unless your website is aimed at a highly specialised technical field, there’s usually no need to get fancy with the words you 
use"
" Clear, simple, well-structured language is the best option when creating a great UX"
" 
• Sticking to conventions"
" As we’ve said before, conventions are excellent shortcuts for keeping things simple for users"
" There’s no need to reinvent 
the wheel and try to teach your users a whole new way of navigating a 
website"
"

"4 Credibility 
Credibility means how trustworthy and legitimate something looks, and is a big 
consideration for web users when deciding to use your website or not"
" Here are 
some of the cues that visitors use to determine the credibility of a website:
• Looks – does it look professional and beautiful?
• Prominent phone numbers and addresses where they are easy to locate – this assures the visitor that there are real people behind the 
website, and that they are in easy reach"
"
• Informative and personal ‘about us’ – your customers want to see the inner workings of a company and are especially interested in learning more about the head honchos"
" Consider including employee pictures 
and profiles to add personality to the site"
" 
• Genuine testimonials – this is a great way to show potential customers what your current customers have to say about your organisation"
" Trust 
is vital, and this is one way to encourage it"
"
Figure 3"
" Genuine user testimonials can create a sense of credibility, as is found here at www"
zipcar 
com
"• Logos of associations and awards – if you belong to any relevant 
industry associations or have won any awards, feature them"
" Not only 
does this go a long way towards establishing your credibility, but it will show that you’re at the top of your game, a notch above the competition"
" 
• Links to credible third-party references or endorsements – this is a way to assert your credibility without tooting your own horn"
" 
• Fresh, up-to-date content – a news section that was last updated a 
year ago implies that nothing has happened since (or that no one cares 
enough to update it)"
"
• No errors – spelling and grammar mistakes are exceptionally 
unprofessional, and while the large majority of readers may not pick them up, the one or two who do will question your credibility"
" This also extends to broken links, malfunctioning tools, and interactive elements 
that don’t work as advertised"
"
5"
"5 Mobile UX
Mobile should not be an afterthought, in UX or any other digital endeavour – it 
should be prioritised in strategy, design and implementation"
" The ‘mobile first’ 
movement supports this notion, and aims to create mobile user experiences first, 
and then adapt these for the web (instead of the other way around)"
" Designing this way has many advantages, since the principles of good mobile UX works just as well on full sites – simple designs, linear interfaces and clear buttons and 
features"
 Mobile first also focuses you on deciding which content is most essential
"
5"
5
"1 Mobile devices
One of the biggest challenges to mobile UX, and indeed any venture involving 
mobile, is the sheer number of different device categories and models available 
– one estimate puts the number of mobile phone handset models at over 6300, 
running over 20 distinct operating systems (CEM4Mobile, 2011)"
"
Broadly speaking, there are five main categories that mobile devices can fall into"
"
• Dumb or basic phones offer no Internet access, just basic call and SMS 
functionality"
"
• Feature phones are rudimentary mobile phones that can perform basic 
communication functions, and possibly connect to the web, but have 
limited functionality"
"
NOTE
Another concept to 
consider here is ‘content first’"
" This is the notion that you should decide which content to provide on your site, depending on whether someone is viewing it from a mobile device or a desktop computer, and then adapt the layout and material to that device"
  The thread uniting these different approaches is a desire to place the user’s needs at the centre of the design
User Experience Design  ›  Mobile UX User Experience Design   ›  Core principles of UX design
"104 105User Experience Design  ›  Mobile UX User Experience Design  ›  Mobile UX
• Smartphones are powerful mini-computers that have full web access, 
larger screens, and a wide range of functionality"
"
• Tablets are larger versions of smartphones, usually including 
touchscreens, and are able to perform a wide range of connectivity, 
lifestyle and work functions"
"
• Other mobile devices – such as ebook readers, netbooks, portable game consoles and other media devices such as iPods – can have a range of features and varying ability to connect to the web"
"

"2 Mobile users 
Mobile users can be different from desktop users"
" There is an ongoing debate about whether the mobile users’ context (for example, lounging on the couch versus 
rushing to a meeting) affects the way in which they use their devices"
" There’s no 
definitive way of defining mobile context – it all comes down to the user, brand and web asset – but it’s important to remember that you need to take the user’s context into account, whatever it may be"
"  We will look at ways of engaging mobile users 
in the Mobile Marketing chapter later in this book, but for now it is important to 
understand some ways in which their behaviour can differ from standard desktop users"
" Mobile users are:
• Goal orientated"
" They turn to mobile devices to answer a question, quickly check email, find information or get directions"
" They often have 
a distinct purpose in mind when using their phone"
"
• Time conscious"
 There are two aspects to this
" On the one hand, mobile 
users are often looking for urgent or time-sensitive information (such as the address of the restaurant they are looking for), so answers should be available as quickly as possible"
" On the other hand, the 
mobile device is also frequently used to kill time or as a source of 
entertainment (reading articles on the couch, or playing games while waiting in a queue), so content is also crucial"
"  User research will tell 
you which of these groups your users fall and how you need to structure 
your site accordingly"
"
• Search dominant"
" Even users who know what they are looking for tend to navigate there via search (for example, typing the brand name into Google) rather than accessing the page from a bookmark or typing the 
URL directly into the browser bar"
"
• Locally focused"
" 50% of all mobile searches in 2012 were for local information (Sterling, 2012)"
" Since mobile phones are always carried, 
users turn to them to find information on things in their surroundings – from local businesses to more detail on a product they have just seen"

 Reasons why people conduct mobile searches

"3 Limitations of mobile
While there are many benefits to mobile, there are also challenges that the UX 
practitioner needs to overcome"
" 
• Small screens"
" Even the largest smartphones are screens many times smaller than a standard laptop (and tablets fall somewhere between 
the two)"
" This, quite simply, means that the user has a much smaller 
window through which to perceive and understand the website, so it’s difficult to get an overall impression of where things are or what’s 
important"
"
• Difficult inputs"
" Mobile phones don’t come with full-sized keyboards and mouses, so they are usually a lot more difficult to operate fluidly 
and accurately than desktop computers (touchscreens may be the exception here, although they also have their own pitfalls)"
"
• Slow connection speeds"
" Many mobile phone users, especially in developing countries, are on slow Internet connections – and even 
fast options such as 3G can often be more sluggish than a desktop 
equivalent"
 This makes loading large websites or images slow and frustrating – and also expensive in terms of data costs
"
• Slow hardware"
" Sometimes the slowness comes from the hardware itself – the more basic the phone, the slower its processing components 
are likely to be, making the simple act of opening the browser and 
loading a page time consuming"
"

"4 Universal mobile UX principles
As will be discussed in the Web Development and Design chapter, there are three 
main approaches to creating mobile-accessible content:
1"
" Mobile websites (called mobi sites)
2"
" Native and web applications (called apps)
3"
 Responsive websites (websites that adapt to the device)
"
Whether you’re designing a mobi website, an app or a nifty responsive site, there are some principles you should always keep in mind:
• Simplify"
 Show information only when it’s needed
" While you should ensure that the mobile asset provides all the same information as the desktop equivalent, this doesn’t need to be presented in the same 
format or volume"
"
• Reduce loading time"
" Try to keep content and actions on the same page, as this ensures better performance as there are fewer page loads"
"
• Encourage exploration"
" Especially on touchscreens, users like to browse elements and explore"
 This makes them feel in control
"
• Give feedback"
 Ensure that it is clear when the user performs an action
" 
This can be achieved through animations and other visual cues"
"
• Communicate consistently"
" Ensure that you deliver the same message across all your touchpoints, for example, by using the same icons on the website as you would on the mobile app – this prevents users from 
having to relearn how you communicate"
"
• Predict what your user wants"
 Include functionality such as auto-complete or predictive text
" Remove as much manual input as possible 
to streamline users’ experience"
"
5"
"6 Step-by-step guide to UX design
The UX design process happens before, during and after the website is being built"
" It ties in very closely with strategy and research, web development and design, 
SEO, content strategy and creation, and later conversion optimisation"

1
" Conduct research and discovery
Step one involves conducting detailed research on the business, the users, and the 
technology involved"
" This is covered fully in the chapter Market Research, which 
includes user research"
 Doing this lets UX practitioners know exactly what they need to do to address the needs of the business and audience
 This will generate a lot of data that needs to be filtered and organised
"

2
" Create the site’s basic structure 
Information architecture (IA) is about managing information – taking a lot of raw data and applying tools and techniques to it to make it manageable and usable"
" 
The purpose of this is to make communication and understanding easier by putting 
information into logical, clear and familiar structures"
"
The information architecture of a site is crucial to usability"
" Categories and pages 
should flow from broad to narrow"
 An intuitively designed structure will guide the user to the site’s goals
"
IA operates on both the micro and the macro level – it covers everything from 
the way individual pages are laid out (where the navigation and headings are, for 
example) to the way entire websites are put together"
"
Most websites have a hierarchical structure, which means there are broad, 
important pages at the top, and narrower, more specific and less important pages further down"
" Hierarchical structures can either be very broad and shallow (many main sections with few lower pages) or very narrow and deep (with few main 
sections and many pages below)"
" It’s up to the UX practitioner to find the right 
balance of breadth and depth"
"

" Analyse content 
If you’re working on a website that already exists, it will be populated with a wide 
variety of content"
" In this case, you need to perform a content audit, which is an 
examination and evaluation of the existing material"
" 
If the website is new – or if you plan to add new content to an existing website – you 
need to put together a content strategy"
" This is a plan that outlines what content is 
needed and when and how it will be created"
 There’s no single template or model for this – every content strategy will be unique
"
The content strategy is largely the responsibility of the strategy, copy and concept 
teams, but the UX practitioner needs to get involved in a few key roles"
" The points 
that UX needs to address are:
• What the site should achieve"
" Naturally, the content should work 
towards achieving the site’s and business’ objectives"
"
• What the user wants and needs"
 By conducting thorough user research you should be able to answer this question
 Provide only content that will add real value to the user
"
• What makes the content unique, valuable or different"
 Content needs to provide value and engagement to the user
"
• The tone and language used"
" You need to give thought here to the tone (fun, light, serious, and so on), register (formal or informal) and style 
you will use across your content"
" Make sure this is consistent across 
text, images, videos and other content types"
"
Principles of creating content
There are three key points you should consider here"
"
1"
" Structure
Content needs to be written so that users can find the information they need as quickly as possible"
 The chapter on Writing for Digital will cover this in more detail
" 
Copy can be made more easily readable by:
• Highlighting or bolding key phrases and words
• Using bulleted lists
• Using paragraphs to break up information
• Using descriptive and distinct headings"
2
" Hierarchy
On the page, use an inverted pyramid style for your copy"
" The important information 
should be at the top of the page, to make for easy scanning"
" The heading comes 
first, the largest and boldest type on the page"
" The subheading or blurb follows 
this, and then the content is presented in a descending scale of importance"
"
3"
" Relevance
Above all, the content on the page must be relevant to the user and the purpose of the page itself"
" If a user clicks to read about a product but ends up on a page with 
content about the company, their experience is going to be tarnished"
"

4
" Create a sitemap  
In UX terminology, a sitemap is the visualised structural plan for how the website’s 
pages will be laid out and organised"
" 
Figure 6"
 An example of a sitemap
"NOTE
Don’t forget SEO"
" There 
are lots of ways in 
which a website can be 
optimised during the 
UX planning process 
– have a look at the 
SEO chapter for some 
guidelines on what to 
include"

"110 111To create the visuals for your sitemap, you can follow this process"
"
1"
" Start by defining your home page – this should be the top item in the 
hierarchy"
" 
2"
 Place the main navigation items below this
"
3"
" Start arranging your pages of content below the main navigational items, according to the results of your user testing and insight, and your 
information architecture structure"
"
4"
 Continue adding pages below this until you have placed all your content
" Make sure that every page is accessible from at least one other page – it 
may seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how often this is overlooked!
5"
" Define any other static navigation elements (footer, sidebar, header 
navigation, search tools)"
" Place these in your diagram in a logical place 
(possibly branching off directly from the home page, or as separate 
blocks)"
"
 
Which sitemap is which?
The term ‘sitemap’ can have two meanings"
" One is the way it’s defined above – 
the structural plan of the website"
 The other is a page on your website that lists all the pages available in a logical and accessible way
" An example is the Apple 
website’s sitemap: www"
apple
com/sitemap
" This sitemap should be available 
from every page"
 Dynamic sitemaps can be employed so that the sitemap is updated automatically as information is added to the website
" Different sitemaps 
exist for different purposes, so investigate what your users would find most useful"
"
 
5"

5
" Build the navigation 
The navigation should guide users easily through all the pages of a website; it is 
not just about menus"
" Successful navigation should help a user to answer four 
basic questions:
1"
" Where am I?
Navigation should let the users know where they are in the site"
" Breadcrumb links, 
clear page titles, URLs and menu changes all help to show the user where he or 
she is"
" The larger your site is and the more levels it has, the more important it 
becomes to give your users an indicator of where they are in relation to everything else on the site"
" This helps the users to understand the content of the page that they are on, and makes them feel more confident in navigating further through 
the site"
Figure 7
 Google’s search results have clear navigation options
"
 
2"
" How did I get here?
Breadcrumb navigation often indicates the general path a user may have taken"
" In 
the case of site search, the keyword used should be indicated on the results page"
"
3"
" Where can I go next?
Navigation clues let a user know where to go to next – such as ‘add to cart’ on an eCommerce site, or a contextual link that indicates ‘read more’"
" The key is making 
the options clear to the user"
"
4"
" How do I get home?
It has become convention that the logo of the website takes the user back to the home 
page, but many users still look in the main menu for the word ‘home’"
" Make sure 
that they can get back to the beginning quickly and easily"
" Test the designs against 
users’ ability to navigate home"
 Never design based on your own assumptions
"  
 
5"
6
6
" Create the layout 
A web page can be broken down roughly into four zones:
The four main zones of a website
NOTE
There is a tendency, 
when thinking about navigation, to plan in only one direction – from the home page down the chain of pages in the hierarchy"
" But very often, users arrive at the site from a link or search result that drops them deep in the website"
 This makes it equally important to look at reverse navigation – getting from the bottom-level pages back up to the top
"
Header

SidebarCentral ContentRight
SidebarUser Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design User Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design"
"112 113Each of these typically contains certain types of elements and content, such as:
1"
" The header, at the top of the page – used to identify the site and provide 
basic tools
• Logo or identifying mark (possibly including the brand’s tagline)
• Main navigation
• Login feature
• Search bar
2"
" The central content area – used to present the main content
• The actual content specific to the page – text, images, videos and more (this can be broken into several columns)
• CTAs of various kinds
3"
" The sidebar, either on the left or the right, or sometimes on both sides – used to present secondary content and tools
• Secondary navigation bar, or other navigation features (for 
example, blog article archive by date)
• CTAs, including buttons and signup forms
• Additional content, like links or snippets
4"
" The footer, at the bottom of the page – used for important but non-
prominent content and resources
• Legal information, privacy policy and disclaimers
• Additional navigation elements"
"
The most important consideration for any page layout is the content – what needs to be included, what is the most important action or piece of information, and how 
can this be structured to meet the user’s needs? After all, web pages are created 
to support a user’s journey"
"
Another important consideration here is the different types of pages that make up 
your website"
" Not all page types can, or should be, structured in the same way"
" For example, your home page is a unique location where you want to showcase the 
most prominent news, offers, features or tools"
" The pages you use for, say, blog 
articles or product listings will be laid out quite differently from the home page, but will have the same structure as each other"
" Then you might have other page types for the login page, and an entirely different approach for your eCommerce 
checkout"
 Wireframes are the skeletal outlines of the layout of a web page
" Their purpose 
is to map out the placement of various elements on the page as a guide for the 
designer to create the visual design, and the web developer to create the code 
and interactivity required"
" Wireframes can be low fidelity (very rough and basic sketches, barely resembling the final output) or high fidelity (very detailed, 
complex layouts including creative elements)"
" Any website project will have 
several wireframes – at least one for each template page"
" Capture your first ideas 
on paper – it’s the fastest and best way to capture good ideas"

"114 115Prototypes are a step up from wireframes, in that they are interactive"
" Prototypes 
are essentially sets of wireframes that have been linked together like a website, so 
that they can be navigated through by clicking and scrolling"
"
Prototypes are excellent tools for testing the flow and function of a proposed website 
before diving into the costly and lengthy design and development phases – they can 
save a lot of time, money and effort by identifying problems and improvements upfront"
" Again, paper prototyping is the best method for fast, iterative UX design"
"

" Assemble the other elements 
Once you’ve defined your content and mapped out the basic layout of each page, 
you need to add in all the extra elements that your website will need – remember 
that the page should only ever contain the elements a user might need to support 
them in their task"
" These can include:
• Calls to action"
" CTAs can take a variety of shapes and forms, from in-text links to large buttons"
"
• Forms"
" These are interactive fields where users can enter their contact details or other information, for example, to sign up for a newsletter or enter a competition"
"
• Search"
" Many sites can benefit from having a search function, both to 
help users navigate and to make finding specific information easier"
" 
Calls to Action
Successful CTAs are simple, quick, clear actions that don’t require the user to do 
anything scary or make a commitment"
" They should always do exactly what they 
state to instil confidence and clarity"
" It’s all about managing the user’s expectations 
– do they actually go where they think they will, or perform the action they expect?
Positioning 
The primary CTA should usually appear above the fold to capture the attention focused here"
" Other CTAs can appear below the fold, and the main CTA can also be 
repeated lower down"
"
Prioritisation 
A single web page can be built around one CTA, or could incorporate a wide range 
of possible desirable actions"
" This all comes down to what the page and website 
overall is seeking to achieve, based on the business requirements"
" When multiple CTAs are used, there should be one primary one that stands out 
strongly and the others should be more muted, playing a supporting role"
" CTAs can be differentiated through colour, shape, placement and size"
" The less choice, 
the better"
"
Figure 9"
" The Lumosity website has a clear primary CTA (in orange) and a less-
prominent secondary CTA (in grey)"
"
Clickability 
Any CTAs that can be clicked must look ‘tactile’, or touchable"
 This means they must stand out somehow from the background and from static elements
" One approach 
is to make the button look like a real button, standing out from its environment"
" 
Another train of thought advocates for the ‘flat design’ approach as a more elegant and modern expression of this"
"

Quantity 
Finally, be sure not to overwhelm users with too many choices"
" Stick to one central 
CTA per page, making it obvious to users what the main goal, action or outcome 
of the page is"

"116 117Forms
Forms are extremely useful tools for gathering user information and encouraging 
interaction on the site"
" Users are generally familiar with them and have some 
experience filling them out, and there are lots of web conventions that govern how 
these should be set up"
" As a general rule, the shorter you can make your form, the better"
" The fewer fields a user has to fill out, the more likely they are to complete the process"
"
Steps and sections
Simple forms with only a few fields can be assembled as a series of boxes"
" For forms that are longer, for example, those in eCommerce checkouts or complex 
registration processes, it makes sense to split them up into manageable portions 
– and manage a user’s expectations by clearly indicating what the next step is"
"
Figure 12"
 The Kalahari
"com checkout process clearly indicates the steps (and 
forms) that the user must complete"
"
Relevance 
Simplicity is a key consideration – forms should be as short and clear as possible"
 The effort must be equal to the reward gained
" All of the fields included must be 
clearly relevant to the purpose of the form, otherwise the user may get confused 
or suspect that you are harvesting their information"
"
Assistance 
It is a good idea to include help for users filling out forms"
" This is especially the case where a specific field requires inputs to be entered in a certain way – and 
doubly so for password fields with special rules"
" Users will not instinctively know 
the rules associated with specific fields, so you must give plenty of guidance along the way"

" (Source: Basecamp)
Validation 
Validation means giving the user feedback on the inputs they have submitted – whether correct or incorrect"
" Validation can happen at two points – after the user 
has submitted the form, or during the process of filling out the form"
" The latter, 
called ‘live inline validation’, usually results in a much better user experience as the users know that their information is correct before submitting the form"
"

"118 119Search
Search has three useful functions on a website – not only does it help users to find 
specific things, it also serves as an essential navigation aid for larger sites, and 
collects valuable data from keyword research about what the user is looking for"
" 
For the most part, the way the search functions is created by the web developer, 
so we won’t go into any technicalities here"
" From the UX practitioner’s perspective, 
there are some important non-technical principles to bear in mind"
"
Positioning
Search will either be the primary starting point for your site, or it will be a useful additional tool"
" In the former case, for example, on a large eCommerce site such 
as Amazon, the search tool should be positioned centrally and visibly to encourage 
the user to use this as the main navigational tool"
" In the latter case, best practice dictates that it should be in the top right corner, or easily accessible in the sidebar"
"
Figure 15"
 The Amazon
com search bar is located prominently at the top of the page
"
Accuracy 
The better you can interpret what your user is searching for, the more relevant and 
accurate the search results can be"
" Google works very hard to fine-tune its search 
algorithm to ensure that users don’t just get what they searched for, but what they 
actually wanted in the first place"
"
User research can suggest why someone would search your site in the first place, 
and what they would typically be looking for"
 Popularity and recentness of content are other key considerations
" 
Results
When it comes to displaying search results, there are a few key questions to ask:
•	How many results should be displayed (per page)? Ten to 20 results per page is generally a good benchmark"
"
•	What order should results be in? Most popular first? Cheapest? Newest? Closest match? This will depend on the nature of the site"
" 
•	Can results be filtered? Some websites allow users to do a second search constrained to the results of the first one"
"•	What happens if there are no results? If no search results are found, 
this should be stated clearly, followed by a list of the closest match 
of content to the search query – it’s quite possible the searcher didn’t know the exact term from what they are looking for or made a typo 
(though the site should be forgiving of these)"
"
 
5"

" Define the visual design
Before a user interacts with your carefully considered content, your excellent 
navigation structure and slick search bar, their first impression comes from the 
look of the website – the colours, graphics, and overall design elements that 
are used"
" As people are spending more and more time on the web, they are less tolerant of websites that don’t look good (and credible)"
" While a website is not an art installation, it is a design project, and the fundamentals of good design apply"
" 
While much of the visual design expertise will come from the graphic designer, it’s 
valuable for the UX practitioner to know the following principles of visual design"
"
Colour 
Colour has an incredible psychological effect on people"
" Based on our culture, 
preferences and learned cues, people interpret colours in very specific ways – and 
this can be used to inform and steer the user’s experience"
"  
When choosing the colour palette for the website, be aware of legibility and 
accessibility concerns"
" Using a lot of open or white space often makes sites appear 
simple and easy to read"
"
Figure 16"
" The Avast! website lays information out clearly and legibly, with good use 
of colour for emphasis"
"

User Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design User Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design
NOTE
For large sites, it can 
also be useful to allow 
users to search within 
categories"
" On Amazon, 
for example, you can 
search just within the 
category ‘books’"
 
"120 121Imagery 
The choice of images used on the website can have a massive effect on how users 
behave and interact on the page"
" You can never be quite certain which images will 
have the best results, so this is one area where you will need to do a lot of testing 
(more on that below)"
"
Humans tend to gravitate towards and identify with pictures of other humans"
" 
We have an innate instinct to look at faces to understand a person’s feelings and 
mood – and we even look in the same direction as these characters, according to 
usability specialist James Breeze (Breeze, 2009)"
"

" Conduct testing 
User testing means giving one or more users access to a website or prototype and observing how they behave when using it"
" The purpose of this is to discover 
problems and gain insights that can be used to improve the final product"
"
The goal of user testing is not to eliminate each and every potential problem on a 
website – that’s simply not possible (especially if you consider how subjective this 
can be)"
 The goal is to work towards creating the best possible experience for the user by constantly improving and optimising
"
The two biggest questions around testing tend to be ‘What do I test?’ and ‘When do 
I test it?’ The answers are simple – test as much as possible, as often as possible, 
and as early as possible"
" 
Figure 17"
 Iterative UX testing process
User testing follows a set process
"
1"
" Formulate a question to test
Spend a little time nailing down exactly why you want to perform a test and what 
you hope to learn from it"
" Formulating a simple, clear set of questions to test will 
allow you to focus on what’s important, and will make choosing participants and 
techniques easier"
"
2"
" Choose a test and prepare
Once you know what the purpose of your test is, you can decide on a specific methodology to use"
" To choose the right one, answer these questions:
• How much time and money do I have for this test?
• What facilities are available?
• How many participants do I want to test?
• At what stage is the project?
User-testing methodologies
There are many ways to conduct UX user testing"
 Here are a few options to get you started
"
Hallway testing
Hallway testing is the name given to quick, informal tests conducted in the office – they often literally involve stopping someone in the hallway and asking them to take part in a quick test"
" 
This is a great way to perform broad, rough testing to help spot any glaring 
errors that the UX team haven’t seen"
"
Observation and user labs
Generally, the purpose of an observational study in a user lab is to get a holistic 
overview of how the user responds to the website, and to spot any major issues"
" Looking at the user’s body language and facial expressions can help to reveal 
how they feel about the experience itself, while looking at how they work through 
the tasks assigned to them shows the usability and intuitiveness of the website"
"
User labs tend to involve one participant at a time being tested and observed 
by one or more researchers"
" Specialised testing labs have features such as 
one-way mirrors and video feeds to facilitate this, but you could easily set up a 
webcam streaming to a computer outside the room to simulate the same effect"
" NOTE
Of course, in the real 
world, time and budget 
limitations will certainly 
have an impact on how 
much you can test – but 
your goal should always 
be to maximise testing, 
in whichever way you can"

improvementsUser Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design User Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design"
"122 123Split testing and multivariate testing 
A split test, also called an A/B test, involves creating two distinct versions of 
the same web page, usually with one specific element changed (for example,  a 
different image or CTA)"
" The versions are served to separate groups of users, and the tester then analyses which page is more effective"
"
A multivariate test functions in the same way, except that several different 
elements on the page are changed at the same time, showing which combination 
of elements works best"
" The chapter on Conversion Optimisation explains these 
in more detail"
"
Eye tracking 
Eye tracking is the process of recording what exactly users are looking at, and how their gaze travels across a web page"
" 
Eye tracking tests are useful for discovering if the user understands and can 
follow the basic flow of the web page, as well as to determine if certain elements 
are where users expect them to be"
" These can be conducted with webcams or 
specialised software that tracks a user’s gaze or a mouse cursor"
"
Surveys 
Surveys are questionnaires, usually distributed remotely via the website, that ask users for their impressions of the site in question"
" Surveys are excellent for 
canvassing opinions of your website after it has gone live"
" 
Surveys can help to answer the ‘why’ questions that arise from quantitative data 
(such as web analytics)"
" For example, you may find that users are abandoning a 
specific page on your website even though it has interesting content"
" The survey may reveal that they find the layout confusing or simply aren’t as interested as 
you thought they’d be"
"
3"
" Find subjects
Possibly the biggest challenge in the testing process is that of finding the right test 
subjects"
" So, how do you do this?
First of all, draw up a list of criteria that you want your subjects to fulfil – must they 
be men or women, of a certain age, in a certain industry, with or without children? 
The considerations can be endless, so limit yourself to the top three or not more 
than five most important ones"
"
Now, spread the word about the test through the most appropriate channels to this 
group"
 This can involve everything from advertising in a glossy magazine to posting on a Facebook page to chatting to some friends or neighbours
" You can also pay a 
market research recruitment agency to find suitable candidates"
" The method you choose will depend largely on your budget and timeline, as well as on how many participants you want to recruit"
" 
Once you get enough responses, you will have the chance to screen applicants"
" 
Screening is the process of filtering people into those who are suitable for the test 
and those who are not, because they do not meet certain criteria"
" 
4"
" Test 
At this point, you are ready to begin testing! Tell the user what you want them to do, and let the test run"
" Don’t interfere!
5"
" Analyse
Analysing means taking all of this existing data and transforming it into accurate, objective and useful insights"
" 
For example, your user observation study found that users tended to click on 
‘contact us’ when looking for the opening times of a restaurant"
" It’s up to the 
researcher to analyse this – were the users confused by something? Was there no 
other obvious place to click? Were they expecting to find this information easily, but found themselves struggling and making a best guess? Discovering the reason can then lead to possible solutions – possibly the opening hours should be placed 
on the home page or in the header; or perhaps they should simply be added to the 
‘contact us’ page"
 It’s these practical outcomes that are the cornerstones of UX testing
"
6"
" Report
Reporting is the process of sharing your UX test results with the people who need them"
" Reports provide insights, information and recommendations by 
summarising the results of the testing phase, and the UX practitioner’s analysis 
of what happened"
" Ideally, the whole team should be involved in analysing the test data to encourage them to buy in to the UX process"
"
Reporting can take various forms, from verbal discussions to professionally 
designed presentations"
" The most important consideration here is your audience 
and their needs"
"
7"
" Implement
Implementing means putting your user testing outcomes into practice"
" This will, of course, mean very different things at different stages of the project"
" If you’re 
testing your overall approach in the beginning planning phase, the implementation could involve taking a new direction on the project"
" Testing a working high-fidelity 
prototype may reveal that some design elements need to change"

" Start again
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again – testing is not a once-off action, it’s a 
constant process"
" Once you’ve run your test and implemented your solutions, your 
project can continue – but very soon you’ll need to test again"
" Aim to run a test 
every time you reach a major new stage of the project, or add something that is brand new or has raised controversy in the team"
" Even after the project has gone live, there is space and reason to keep testing, iterating and optimising"
"

"7 Tools of the trade
UX tools range from rudimentary (pen and paper) to highly sophisticated (web applications and tech tools)"
 Here is a brief roundup of popular options
"
Balsamiq (www"
balsamiq
"com) bills itself as a ‘rapid wire-framing tool’ and is 
great for creating fun, low-fidelity wireframes and simple prototypes"
" It works both 
as a web app and a desktop download, and has built-in features for collaborating 
with other team members"
" 
Axure (www"
axure
"com) is an all-purpose prototyping tool that allows you to create 
fully interactive wire-framed websites without needing to code anything"
" A useful 
feature is that it also generates technical specifications for developers to work 
from, based on the interactions and links you create in the prototyping process"
" 
Gliffy (www"
gliffy
"com) is a web-based tool that allows you to create a wide range 
of diagrams – everything from wireframes to sitemaps to charts"
" It offers a free 
version, with a paid Pro Account that offers more advanced features"
" While its 
strength lies in wire-framing, it also creates sitemaps, which means you could 
have several features in one place"
"
Morae (www"
techsmith
com/morae
"html) is a good place to start if you’re looking 
for a web-based replacement for user labs"
" This innovative paid-for tool allows you to research users interacting directly with your, or a competitor’s, website"
" The 
tool records video and audio of the user, and also captures their behaviour on the 
screen, so you can remotely watch exactly what they are doing and how they are reacting in person"
" The tool also allows you to prompt and interact with the user in 
real-time chat, track where they look on the screen, and more"

"8 Case study: Rail Europe

"1 One-liner
Rail Europe applied solid UX principles to overhaul their website and create an excellent  
user experience"
"
 
5"
8
"2 The problem
Rail Europe is a company that sells European rail tickets to American customers, helping them 
plan and book their railway arrangements before they travel"
" 
In Europe, the rail network is comprehensive and frequently used"
" In the US, however, rail travel is 
uncommon and often unsatisfactory, so American customers are either unfamiliar with it (sparking 
uncertainty) or have likely had a negative experience, meaning they would be hesitant to try again"
"
The challenge was to create an experience that would resonate with US customers, provide them 
with accurate and useful information, and give them the confidence to book a railway journey"
" While Rail Europe already offered an advanced booking engine that covered 15 000 destinations, the key was to give customers a variety of flexible booking options, encourage them to actively 
explore, and to come out of the process feeling fully informed and confident"
"
5"
8
"3 The solution
Rail Europe engaged UX specialist agency Adaptive Path to recreate their website so that it would 
create the required experience"
" 
Naturally, it was vital to understand the users and their unique needs, wants and concerns"
" The 
following information and research was collated:
• A prioritised list of information that was crucial for customers to make the  
correct booking
• Feedback from current website users and customers
• Usability barriers that Rail Europe had already identified 
• Best practice guidelines and insights from other travel sites  
Rather than launching directly into the website build, Adaptive Path took time during the concept stage to interrogate the data and hone in on what customers really needed"
" Their research process 
covered a series of conceptual phases:
1"
" They devised a user journey, corresponding to what 80% of Rail Europe customers would typically do, that flowed from the exploration stage (scheduling, planning) right through to 
booking and purchase"
 User Experience Design  ›  Case Study: Rail Europe User Experience Design  ›  Step-by-step guide to UX design
126 1272
" From this, they identified key decision-making moments and information, which included 
dates, times, schedules and customer service"
" 
3"
" They then developed a sequence of interactions that would lead customers through the booking and purchase process, ensuring that all the necessary information was visible 
and that the customer could easily move back and forward through the process"
"
4"
" Finally, Adaptive Path revised the interface to make sure its American audience had a 
seamless travel experience, taking factors such as travel times, connections, available amenities and correct seat bookings into account"
"
Figure 18"

" (Source: Adaptive Path)
Once the final proposal was ready, Adaptive Path and Rail Europe worked together to refine and 
improve the model, taking both UX principles and specific customer knowledge into account"
"

8
"4 The results
The new website was a hit with customers, who found it easier to book rail tickets"
" By giving 
customers confidence and taking the stress out of the process, Rail Europe could play an important 
role in making the overall travel experience more enjoyable"
"
After launching the website redesign, Rail Europe achieved a 3% conversion rate – the highest in 
its history, and impressive for an online booking site"
" It also found that certain badly performing 
products were now on an upward booking trend"
"
By the end of 2012, Rail Europe had become the number one online distributor of rail tickets, 
serving 900 000 customers that year"
" This indicates that good UX is not important just for short-term gains; it helps a brand build its reputation for professionalism, great service and reliability "
"
 5"
"9 The bigger picture
UX touches on so many aspects of digital marketing that it’s hard to list them all"
" It’s involved right up front at the strategy and research phase, and then touches on all the Create disciplines – web 
development, design and copywriting"
" 
It also helps make the most of Engage tactics by ensuring they are conceptualised with users 
in mind"
" For example, when it comes to search engine optimisation (SEO), Google introduced an 
update to its algorithm that would assess the UX design on a website as part of the overall decision on where to rank it"
" Matt Cutts, a Google Engineer, stated that: “We’ve heard complaints from 
users that if they click on a result and it’s difficult to find the actual content, they aren’t happy with 
the experience"
"” 
Social media, email marketing, display advertising, video marketing and other fields can also 
benefit from solid UX thinking – what do users want, need and expect from you on these channels?
Finally, UX goes hand in hand with web analytics data – both disciplines aim to understand users 
and create real, actionable insights from the data gathered about them"
 Quantitative and qualitative data make up the basis of sound UX thinking and decision making
"
 
5"
"10 Summary
Users come first when creating any web-based marketing channels"
" Core UX principles such as 
user-centric design, web conventions, simplicity and credibility are essential for creating web 
experiences that are seamless, memorable and valuable to users"
"
Mobile UX is a special subset of the discipline that takes the unique context and characteristics 
of mobile users into account – whether for designing a mobi site, an app or a responsive website"
"
When it comes to implementing a UX process, the following steps should be followed:
1"
" Identify business requirements – what does the business need to get out of the site?
2"
" Conduct user research – who are you building the site for, and why? What information 
do they need? How will they move through the site?
3"
" Create the basic structure – what goes into a solid information architecture?
4"
" Analyse and plan content – how should content be put together here?
5"
" Design the sitemap – how will the overall website be structured?
6"
" Build and develop the navigation – how will users get to where they need to go?
7"
" Create the layout – what will each page look like, from top to bottom? What content is needed for this page to achieve its business goals?
8"
" Add other useful elements – how will CTAs, search tools and forms behave?

"1 Introduction
Websites are, in many ways, at the heart of successful digital marketing"
" They are 
your home on the web, a shop window over which you have full control, and often 
the first place people stop to find out more about you"
" 
Web development and design applies to more than just websites – the principles 
can be used for any digital assets you create, from mobile platforms to social 
media profiles"
"
Creating online assets involves three key processes – planning and design, which 
create the appearance, layout and style that users see, and development, which brings this imagery to life as a functioning web tool"
"
The fundamental principle of good development and design is to understand your 
users: the people who will actually be using and interacting with your website"
" 
What are they looking for? What are their objectives? Your offering must have user experience central to the process"
" 
In this chapter, you will learn:
• How the web development process works, from planning through to 
design and launch"
" 
• Development and design best practices and the principles of designing for persuasion"
" 
• How to assess the quality and effectiveness of web development and 
design implemented by suppliers or agencies"

"3 Web design
 
Web design is the process of creating all the visual aspects of the interface"
" This 
covers the layout, colour scheme, images, logos, type, design elements (such as 
buttons and links), and anything else that you can see"
"
The web is a visual medium, so design is a very important part of creating 
successful assets that are both engaging and effective"
" At the same time, however, designers need to keep in mind the technical aspects of design, as well as the all-important human factor"
" Digital properties shouldn’t just be beautiful; they also 
need to create a good experience for the visitor and meet business objectives"
"

"1 Visual identity and designing for persuasion
 
The visual interface – the design of a website – is what the user sees and interacts 
with"
" It’s the visual representation of all the hard work that goes into developing a 
website"
" It’s what the site will first be judged by, and is the initial step in creating a 
delightful user experience"
" In case you haven’t realised it, it matters a lot"
"
There is a close relationship between UX and visual design – sometimes these 
are even done by the same person"
" At other times, the visual designer will use the documents created by the UX designer and add the visual skin"
" In this case, it’s like 
comparing the architect (UX designer) to the interior decorator (visual designer)"
"
Design is not just about aesthetics, although looks are very important"
" Design is 
about the visual clues we give users so that they know what to do next"
" Design is 
the way in which we communicate with our users"
" It assures web visitors of our credibility and ability to answer their questions, and turns them into customers"
"
Good interface design involves many things (including years of training and 
experience), but here are a few basic considerations"
" These are closely linked to UX and the visual designer plays a key role in defining them:
• Navigation: the signage of the site, indicating to users where they are and where they can go"
"
• Layout: how content is structured and displayed"
"
• Headers: the usually consistent top part of a web page"
"
• Footers: as you may have guessed, the usually consistent bottom part of the page"
"
• Credibility: telling users that you are who you say you are"
"
Visual identity
The visual identity answers the question: “How do users know it’s us?”
Certain design elements should be carried through on all web assets created for 
a brand, as well as print and traditional communication media"
" Often, the visual 
identity guidelines for the web are codified into a Digital Style Guide document 
to ensure consistency across different agencies, designers and teams"
" This document can include guidelines for creating all manner of web assets, including 
banners, social media content, and website design elements"
Web Development and Design  ›  Web design Web Development and Design  ›  Key terms and concepts
136 137The logo is the most prominent way to reinforce your brand identity on the website
" 
The logo is part of a brand’s corporate identity (CI)"
" Be aware that logos designed 
for printing on letterheads will need to be adapted for the web and legibility, particularly when it comes to resizing"
"
The primary font is typically used for prominent headings on the site, while body 
copy is often set in a standard web font that closely matches the primary font"
"
Font replacement is widespread and involves embedding non-web safe fonts 
into the code, using Typekit, for example"
" With Typekit, subscribers can embed 
simple code that allows them to choose from hundreds of fonts for their website (Wikipedia, 2013)"
" However, the growing popularity of HTML5 in modern browsers 
makes font replacement less necessary"
"
Menu and button style, as well as icons, are also part of a site’s visual identity"
" Even 
when a user is viewing a small part of a site or page, it should look as if it belongs 
to the site as whole"
"

"2 Design theory
 
Design can be a pretty precise science – there is a lot of research out on what 
makes for effective design"
" A lot is also common sense and practice based on 
accepted web standards"
 Here are some concepts you should know
"The fold
The fold is the imaginary line at the bottom of the monitor that divides the immediately visible part of the website (content above the fold) from the part that 
is visible only after scrolling down (content below the fold)"
"
Your most important message, content or Call to Action should usually be placed 
above the fold"
" It is worth mentioning here that the concept of above the fold has 
come across some scrutiny, because it is not always useful"
"
Consistency
Consistency in use of visual elements is vital to your online presence – across all your properties and channels (such as your email newsletter, Facebook page 
and mobi site) – as users do not perceive differences between platforms or even 
on- or offline"
 They perceive it as one message on multiple touchpoints
" Within a website, elements should also be consistent"
" Colour coding, or colour themes, can be used very successfully to group areas or features on a website"
" For example, if 
the help button and help navigation are coloured yellow, then the user will quickly 
associate yellow with support and assistance"
 This is another useful shortcut to making the site usable and intuitive
"

White space
Spacing on the page allows the eye to travel easily between chunks of information 
and allows scanning"
 This can be done by using what is called white space
" This 
NOTE
Not every user will see 
the same amount of content above the fold, since some screens are smaller than others"
 Check your web analytics data to see what common screen sizes are used and tailor your content to the lower end of the spectrum to ensure that more people see your key message
Web Development and Design  ›  Web design Web Development and Design  ›  Web design
"138 139space is not necessarily white, but instead is merely empty"
" It refers to the space 
between elements on a page"
" 
Always steer clear of cluttered pages"
" This is especially true for landing pages, 
where a very specific message is expected"
" Make your pages as simple and easy 
to understand as possible"
"
If you look at the example below, you can see how detailed information can be 
simplified, which in this case led to a 14% increase in website visitors"

"3 Colour theory
 
Colour has an incredible psychological effect on people"
" Based on our culture, preferences and learned cues, people interpret colours in very specific ways – and 
this can be used to inform and steer the user’s experience"
" Colour theory online 
refers to the principles of combining colours to attract people toward your brand and its offerings (Focus Designer, 2012)"
"
Figure 4"
" A colour wheel shows how the colours red, yellow and blue appear when 
mixed together "
" (Source:  Ibrahim, 2010)
Most of the colour choices will be dictated by the CI, but tones and shades will be 
selected by the designer"
"
Contrast is very important when displaying text online"
" If the text and background 
are the same colour and there is no contrast, this means that the text will not be readable"
" Best practice is to use a light background colour and a dark colour for 
the text"
 Black text on a white or light grey background works well
" Contrast is also 
a good way to draw your reader to and differentiate between different aspects of the page"
" 
Colours also hold different meanings and associations for people"
" Ensure that you 
know these meanings for the audience that you are targeting – for example, red 
signifies luck in Asian cultures, but danger in many western cultures"

NOTE
The colour wheel 
helps designers to find colours that work well together and create a colour scheme"
" Colours that appear opposite each other, like red and green, are known as complimentary colours"
" For example, red and green are often used for buttons that appear close together as the colours contrast and highlight each other"

"  (KISSmetrics, 2010)
There are some colour-related web design conventions you should follow:
• Red is used for warnings, error messages and problems"
"
• Green is used for successful actions, next steps and correct submissions"
"
• Blue is best used for hyperlinks"
"
Your Call to Action is one of the most important parts of your website and can be 
displayed as a link or button"
" As this is meant to attract the eye, choose a colour that stands out"
" When Dmix tested this out, as you can see in this example, they 
experienced an increase of 72% in conversions by using the more striking red 
button instead of the green one  (Chopra, 2010)"

"4 Collecting and collating design assets
 
Elements such as your logo and brand colours represent your brand"
" The latest 
versions of these brand assets need to be available to the designer or marketing 
agency designing your website"
" 
Getting the right brand assets to designers in a good-quality format that they 
can easily access saves time and avoids expensive mistakes"
" By doing this, your 
campaign won’t be designed with the wrong version of your logo or with incorrect brand colours"
" 
Here is a list of brand assets that a designer requires to start working on your project"
" 
The quality, format (or file type) and file size are all important considerations"
"
 
You need to provide: 
•	 Brand guidelines or style guide in Adobe Reader (PDF) format"
"
•	 Logo and other key brand elements"
 These could be in Illustrator format (ai) or Photoshop format (psd)
 Best practice is to have your logo designed using vector graphics
" If your logo or other brand assets are created in 
this format, they can be enlarged without losing quality"
" Other formats 
do not allow scaling and if displayed larger than the original designer intended will result in a poor-quality image"
" If you do not have a vector version of your logo available, then you should make sure that your image 
is at least 1 000 pixels wide"
" 
•	 Image libraries"
" Photographs and images can be hosted online, where 
the designer can access them with a login"
" They can also be sent to the 
designer on a CD"
 Make sure the images are of sufficient quality
 It is best practice to provide images that are 300dpi
" This is the measure of 
a high-quality image that will retain its quality if resized"
" Although all 
images on the web are displayed at 72dpi, a higher quality image will give your designer room to optimise and resize and crop or cut images 
where needed"
" 
•	 Fonts folder"
" You will need to provide both Apple Mac and PC versions 
of the fonts that are listed in your Style Guide"
" Many designers work on 
Macs, which use different font versions from those read by PCs"
" 
•	 Brand colours need to be given to digital designers in RGB format"
" RGB stands for red, green and blue and is the standard for colours online"
"
NOTE
If you do not own the 
image and the copyright is not owned by you it is illegal to use the image on your site without permission from the owner"
" If you require images, these can be purchased from stock libraries online such as iStock or Shutterstock"
 Avoid using images from Google Image Search on your pages
Web Development and Design  ›  Web design Web Development and Design  ›  Web design
"142 143• Any existing creative assets that have been created for your brand over 
time such as: 
o Print designs
o TV ads 
• Website copy should be made available before the final design is 
required"
 This prevents delays caused by designers waiting for material
" 
• Any additional assets your designer may need that can be downloaded or 
sent, such as your price guides or product descriptions"
"
Fonts
Copy conveys your brand message to your client or customer and should be easy to read and search engine friendly"
" The CI is expressed through fonts, also known 
as typefaces"
"
Typographic layout can draw attention to the content users should see first"
" 
Indicate which pieces of information take precedence"
" Importance can be signified 
by text size, colour, weight, capitalisation and italics"
 Placement also contributes to how important text appears
"
Some fonts are common to all computer users"
" These fonts are known as web-
safe fonts"
" Anyone accessing websites that use these fonts will be able to view them as the designer intended and search engines will be able to search these 
websites easily"
" Fonts that are not web safe may appear very differently on some 
computers"
" Designers don’t always like to be limited to using only web-safe fonts, and brand guidelines in most instances don’t take web-safe fonts into account"
" This means that fonts must be embedded by a developer using tools such as 
Typekit, or alternative fonts need to be selected"

"4 Web development 
 
Web development is the process of taking finished web designs and transforming them into fully functioning, interactive websites"
" Development is what gives life 
and movement to the static designs, and enables users to access the website 
through their web browsers"
 This is done by translating the designs into web-coding languages that can be interpreted and displayed by web browsers
"
Learning to code your own website is not in the scope of this textbook and requires 
years of practice and some considerable technical know-how"
" But we can teach 
you to understand the aspects that go into creating a website, the process that 
should be followed, and how to help in making key choices about your website"
"
When developing a website, you need to make three key decisions (don’t worry, 
we’ll explain each one below):
• Should your website be static or should it have a content management system (CMS)?
• Which server-side language should be used?
• Which front-end language should you use?
6"
4
"1 Static website or CMS
 
A static website, as the name implies, is one that does not change often – other than the occasional update, the website stays the same over time and no new 
content is added"
" Should new content be required, a web developer would need 
to add it"
" 
CMS stands for content management system"
" A CMS is used to manage the content 
of a website"
" If a site is updated frequently and if people other than web developers need to update the content of a website, a CMS is used"
" Today, many sites are 
built on a CMS, which can also allow content of a website to be updated from any 
location in the world by signing into an online management interface for the CMS"
"
There are three types of CMS you can choose from:
• Bespoke: This is a CMS that is built specifically for a certain website, 
and many web-development companies build their own CMS that they 
use for their clients"
" This option is highly tailored and customised to your website, and can be more expensive than other options"
" It is also possibly 
less flexible"
"NOTE
Some web-safe fonts 
are: Times New Roman; 
Arial; Helvetica; Courier 
New; and Lucida 
Console"
" See the full 
list here: http://www"
"

NOTE
You can also use Google 
fonts as an alternative, 
which are more stylish 
than standard fonts but 
which are still viewable 
by most people"

implement these"

"144 145• Off the shelf: A CMS can also be pre-built by an external company or 
developer"
 These can be bought like any other software on the market
" 
While this may have fewer custom features, it’s potentially a more cost-
effective option than a bespoke CMS"
"
• Open source: There are many open source, pre-built CMS options available, some of which are free"
" Open source means that anyone can see the code that the CMS is built with, and can manipulate or improve it 
(and share this with everyone else using the CMS)"
" An open-source CMS 
can be more rudimentary than paid options, but is also easy to tailor to your needs, and there is often a community that can create the solutions you need"
"
 
Some widely used open-source CMS solutions include:
• WordPress (www"
wordpress
"com)
• Joomla (www"
joomla
"org)
• Drupal (www"
drupal
"com)
 
A CMS should be selected with the goals and functions of the website in mind"
" A CMS needs to be able to scale along with the website and business that it supports, 
and not the other way round!
Of course, the CMS selected should result in a website that is search engine friendly"
" 
Here are some key features to look out for when selecting or building a CMS:
• Meta and title tag customisation: the CMS should allow you to enter your 
own meta tags for each page, as well as allow full customisation of title tags for each page"
" 
• URLs: instead of using dynamic parameters, the CMS should allow for clean URLs by using server-side rewriting"
" Clean URLs consist only of 
the path to a webpage without extra code (a clean URL could look like 
this: http://example"
"com/cats, while an unclean URL could look like 
this: http://example"
com/index
php?page=cats)
" It should allow for the 
creation of URLs that are:
o static
o rewritable
o keyword richBe careful when building clean, descriptive and dynamic URLs from CMS content"
" Should you use a news heading (‘Storm’, in this example) as part 
of your URL (http://www"
site
"com/cape/storm) and someone changes 
the heading to ‘Tornado’ (http://www"
site
"com/cape/tornado), this will 
alter the URL and the search engines will index this as a new page, but with the same content as the URL which had the old heading"
" Bear this in 
mind before adding dynamic parameters to your URLs"
"
• Customisable navigation: a good CMS will allow flexibility when it comes 
to creating the information architecture for a website"
" For the purposes of adding additional content for search engines, a CMS should not require that all content pages be linked to from the home page navigation"
" 
This allows content to be added for search engine optimisation (SEO) 
purposes, without adding it to the main navigation"
"
• The CMS needs to have good support for managing SEO considerations such as URL rewriting and avoiding duplicate content issues"
"
• Customisable image naming and alt tags for images: a good CMS will allow you to create custom alt tags and title attributes"
"
• Robots"
"txt management: ensure that you are able to customise the 
robots"
"txt to your needs, or that this can at least be managed using the meta tags"
"
Finally, using a CMS that supports standards-compliant HTML and CSS is very important, as without it, inconsistencies may be rendered across various browsers"
" 
It also ensures faster loading time and reduced bandwidth, makes mark-up easier 
to maintain, supports SEO efforts and ensures that every visitor to a website, no matter what browser they are using, will be able to see everything on the website"

"2 Server-side languages
 
Server-side languages are the ‘hidden’ web coding languages that determine how your website works and communicates with the web server and your computer"
" 
The most popular server-side framework for each language is also discussed"
"
When choosing a server-side language, you need to consider:
• Cost: The cost varies depending on the language you choose for your 
web development project, as the language chosen directly influences the 
salary of the developer"
" If information is processed where your website is housed, as opposed to on the client’s computer, it increases the 
costs"
" Some languages also require on-going website management and 
maintenance, which is an additional cost to consider"
"  NOTE
A web application 
framework (WAF) is software used to help create dynamic web properties more quickly"
 This is done by accessing libraries of code for a specific language and other automated or simplified processes that do not need to be coded from scratch

"
Some of the most common and popular server-side languages include PHP, Java, Ruby and the "
NET languages
 Ask your web developer to advise you on the best language for your specific project
"

"3 Front-end languages
 
Web users have come to expect rich, interactive experiences online, and interactive website interfaces are a part of that"
" Front-end languages, or “client-side” 
languages, are languages that are interpreted and executed in the user’s browser 
rather than on the web server"
"
These experiences range from simple animations through to highly responsive 
interfaces that require input from the user"
" There are several technologies available to create such experiences, each with its own opportunities and challenges"
"
As with server-side languages, you need to consider a few properties of the front-
end language you want to use"
" Bear in mind that server-side languages and front-end languages are often used together, as all web projects require front-end 
languages for development"
" 
• Cost: Front-end language development costs are relatively low"
"
• Features: HTML, CSS and JavaScript are open source languages often 
used together and are compatible with most hardware and software"
" 
Content developed in these is also more search engine friendly"
" Flash is known for its video, animation and interactive multimedia capabilities"
" In many cases, similar results can be achieved with HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript"
" Flash can be used alone or in conjunction with other 
languages"
 What your end users will be able to view should always be the most important consideration
" 
• Scalability: Depending on the capabilities of the device executing the 
language, certain features may not be available or certain code may run too slowly to create a good user experience"
" The front-end code needs to 
take all the considered devices into account"
"• Browser and OS support: With front-end languages, you have to cater 
for browser and operating system support"
  A website will look different on each browser and operating system and this needs to be factored in
" 
If a feature cannot be displayed under certain conditions, work-arounds have to be implemented"
" 
• Open-source or proprietary software: Any developer can create add-
ons for or improve on open-source software, while proprietary software 
is owned and its use is restricted"
" It can be cheaper to develop in an open-source front-end language such as HTML, but as HTML is needed 
to host all web pages, combinations of the two are sometimes used"
"  In 
most cases and for the languages we cover, however, this is not a major consideration"
" 
There are several options to choose from when it comes to front-end languages, although the most popular by far are HTML, coupled with CSS and JavaScript"
"
 
HTML5
HTML is the language for creating websites and HTML5 is the fifth iteration of the language"
" It is also the name for a range of technologies that enable modern web 
browsing features"
" It’s a specification published by the web standards body (W3C) 
describing what features are available and how to use them"
" HTML5 is different from proprietary web software such as Adobe Flash in that the specification is the result of contributions from many organisations, and can be implemented by 
anyone without having to pay for royalties or licensing fees"
" You do, however, pay 
for the development tools provided by the companies"
"

" There is also a technology called Canvas, which allows developers 
to create rich interactive experiences without the constraints that came with 
previous versions of HTML"
" For example, a 3D animated video can now be played – something that used to require the use of Flash or Silverlight"
" 
The goal is a website that just works, without the need for particular browsers or 
plug-ins to enable certain functionality"
" To this end, having a standardised way of

CSS

" CSS 
can set many properties including the size, colour and spacing around the text, as well as the placement of images and other design-related items"
"
 
JavaScript
This is the most common client-side language used to create rich, dynamic web 
properties"
" Because it is an open-source language, many developers have added 
functionality that can be more quickly implemented"
" For example, there are over 
1 000 different gallery systems created by JavaScript developers for JavaScript developers"
" 
 
Flash
Adobe Flash is a language for creating rich, interactive experiences"
" It supports 
video, and is often used to create game-like web experiences"
" Although widely 
supported by desktop browsers, it has limited (and lessening) support on mobile 
devices, and is not usable on Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad"
" It has a history of being problematic for SEO, although there are ways to work around much of this"

"5 Mobile development
 
Mobile Internet usage has increased dramatically in the last few years and, according to the Washington Post, is predicted to continue increasing by 66% 
globally each year (Kang, 2013)"
" Because of this, it’s important for all brands to make themselves accessible on 
mobile devices"
" As you learnt in the User Experience Design chapter, mobile devices 
can fall into a range of categories"
"
Developing for the mobile phone requires an understanding of the opportunities 
and challenges presented by mobile technology"
" Challenges include the obvious, such as a smaller screen and navigation limitations, as well as more complex 
issues such as file formats"

"1 Which mobile experience should you create?
 
When creating a platform for mobile users to access your content and brand, you 
have three options:
1"
" Mobile website
2"
" Mobile application
3"
" Responsive website
 
Mobile websites make it possible for users to access information about your brand 
on the move wherever they may be, as long as their phone has a browser and an 
Internet connection"
" 
Mobile websites need to be designed with the mobile device in mind"
" Mobile 
website interfaces demand a simpler approach, and a consideration of screen size 
and input method"
" 
A native mobile app is software designed to help users perform particular tasks"
" 
Examples include a tool for checking the weather, a fuel calculator or a recipe 
index"
"
Mobile apps can be sold, or made available for free"
" There are many developers 
who create apps in order to derive an income, while free apps that offer users 
value are often sponsored by brands or advertising"
 An app can be an excellent tool for connecting with your customer
" 
The key difference between native applications and mobile websites is that 
websites can be accessed using any Internet-enabled mobile device, while applications are designed for particular handsets and operating systems and have 
to be downloaded to the mobile device"
" That said, mobile apps generally allow for 
more integration with the device and hence a better user experience, depending 
on the complexity of the functionality"
"NOTE
Remember, mobile goes 
beyond just the mobile 
phone – also consider 
tablets, game consoles, 
netbooks and a range 
of other web-enabled 
devices"

"
Should you wish to target Apple and BlackBerry users, for example, you will need to 
create two different applications or focus on making a cross-platform application – something that can be difficult and expensive"
" 
It is a good idea to focus on mobile sites when targeting a broader group and 
building an application when wanting to reach a niche or targeted audience"
" 
A responsive website is a website that changes its layout depending on the device 
it is displayed on – it looks one way on a desktop computer, but then adapts to the 
smaller screen size and layout on a tablet or mobile phone"
" In this way, a single development project can cater for multiple device form factors"
"

 Elements shift and rearrange on a responsive website
"Creating a responsive website means you only need to build one website for the 
full range of devices, from desktop to mobile"
" This can be a technically challenging 
exercise and will require a lot of planning upfront to make sure that the site displays correctly on each device"
"
Here is a table that compares the relative strengths and weaknesses of each 
option"
" There’s no right or wrong answer on which one to pick – choose the option 
that suits your brand, target audience and digital objectives best"

Strengths Weaknesses
Mobi site Accessible from any web-enabled 
phone
Generally the simplest, cheapest 
and quickest option to develop
Easy to useCan link to content within and 
outside of the site and reap the SEO benefits Limited functionality
Uses a separate code base from 
the full website
Native app Versatile and creative tools can be created
Interactive and funCan create real added value

Ideal for frequently repeated or 
routine tasks

"152 153Design your site so that the information your users want is not only on display, but 
also easy to get to"
" The limited screen space is valuable, so you can’t necessarily 
have the full site navigation on every page"
" The information architecture of your 
site is therefore essential to ensuring you make the most logical use of navigation in line with what your site visitors need"
 There are benefits to mobile development that can help you get around this
" 
 
Standards
There are few mobile standards currently in place"
" Creating content (including 
images, text and beyond) that can be correctly formatted on most phones (or at 
least legible on phones where formatting is flawed) is still not entirely possible"
" 
There is therefore a certain amount of trial and error involved in designing a mobile site"
" The process is certainly worth it, though, considering that there are 3"
"4 billion unique mobile phones, and a fair number of these are accessing the mobile web 
(International Telecommunication Union, 2013)"
" 
Mobile handset emulators allow you to see how your work-in-progress website will 
be formatted, depending on which device you are emulating"
" It has been suggested that nothing can replace testing on actual mobile devices, so if you are doing the testing, recruit contacts with different handsets to show you the difference in 
display"

"3 Responsive design
 
Responsive websites are designed for a range of screen widths"
" When deciding whether to create a responsive site or separate mobi and desktop sites, consider 
your customer first:
• How much of your website traffic comes from (specific) mobile devices? If this is a large percentage, consider building a dedicated mobile 
site"
 Bear in mind that the popularity of particular mobile devices can change quickly as consumer preferences evolve
"• Do your desktop users have the same goals as your mobile users? If your mobile consumer’s goals are very different, then you may want to consider building a separate mobile site"
" 
• What is your budget and how quickly do you need your website to be built? Responsive websites take longer to build and can be more 
expensive"
" You could save money long term by going this route, but 
there is a sizeable upfront investment"
" 
• Do you have an existing site, and can it be converted into a responsive website, or will it need to be rebuilt (Du Plessis, 2012)?
 
Responsive design comes with a fair bit of terminology, but there are three key concepts with which you should be familiar"
"
 
Flexible grid
Typical websites are designed as a large, centred, fixed-width block"
" With 
responsive design, the page elements (the heading; the text or copy; the main 
image; and other blocks of information) are arranged in a grid of columns that have 
predefined spacing"
  Each element relates proportionally to the other elements
 This allows elements to rearrange or resize in relation to each other whether the screen is tiny or huge and the screen quality is high or low
" Although this system 
allows for flexibility, an extremely narrow screen can cause the design to break 
down"
 In this case we can make use of media queries
"
 
Media queries
Media queries are bits of code that allow websites to ask devices for information 
about themselves"
" It then selects the website style that will suit the device best 
from a list of styles defined in a CSS"
" Media queries ask for information about 
the device’s browser window size, orientation (landscape or portrait) and screen display quality"
"
 
Flexible images
Images are designed to move and scale with the flexible grid"
" How fast the website 
loads is an important consideration, so high-quality images are made available 
for larger screens and lower-resolution images are made available for smaller 
screens, according to the information received from the media query"
 Parts of images can also be displayed for smaller screens to maintain image quality
 Images can even be hidden completely

"6 Step-by-step guide to building a website
 
This section discusses the process of building a website from the client’s 
perspective"
 There are different approaches to building a website
" The one 
described here is the waterfall process, where one step follows the other"
" This is in 
contrast with other methods such as the Agile methodology, which involves faster iteration and greater collaboration, but doesn’t afford clients as much control and upfront clarity on the deliverables and timelines"
"
Step 1: Planning and research
Planning a website starts with research: your market, your users, your competitors and your business"
" If you already have a website, you can use existing web analytics 
data to understand how well you are meeting your users’ needs"
" It’s also worth 
running some user labs to watch how users interact with your existing site"
 Have a look at the Market Research chapter for a detailed discussion of this
"
Key questions you need to ask:
• Business: What are your business objectives? How should this digital 
property help you to achieve those objectives? (For example, should it generate leads for you to follow up on? Is it an eCommerce store?)
• Users: Who are your users, your potential customers? What problem 
does your website need to help them solve? (For example, collate travel information in one place, such as with www"
tripit
com
") 
This research helps you to plan your website strategically, ensuring that it is aligned with both user needs and business objectives"
" 
In research and planning, you should also reach an understanding of what tasks 
(or actions) users need to do on your website"
 These are usually in line with your business objectives
" Some tasks a user may need to do include checking the 
availability of a hotel, signing up to a newsletter, or printing information"
"
Step 2: Choosing a domain name
Domain names are important"
 They are part of the URL of a website
" 
A domain name looks something like this: www"
mycompany
comBut a lot more information can be included in this
" Domain names can carry the 
following information:
 subdomain"
domain
"tld/directory
• Domain – the registered domain name of the website
• Subdomain – a domain that is part of a larger domain
• TLD – the top level domain, uppermost in the hierarchy of domain names 
• directory – a folder to organise content 
 
The TLD can indicate the country in which a domain is registered, and can also give 
information about the nature of the domain"
"
• "
"com – the most common TLD
• "
co
"za, "
co
"uk, "
com
"au – these TLDs give country information
• "
"org – used by non-profit organisations
• "
"gov – used by governments
• "
"ac – used by academic institutions
 
Domain names must be registered and in most cases there is a fee for doing so"
" 
Many hosting providers will register domain names on your behalf, but you can 
also do it yourself"
"
Domain names should be easy to remember, and if possible, include important 
search keywords for your business"
" For example, if you were building a website 
for your restaurant named Omega, www"
omegarestaurant
com could be a better choice than www
omega
com as it contains the important keyword ‘restaurant’
"
Step 3: UX and content strategy
You also need to gather, analyse and map out what content is needed on the website"
 This content is then structured in a process called information architecture
" A 
sitemap should reflect the hierarchy of content on the website, and navigation 
(how users make their way through a website)"

"156 157Before a website is designed and developed, it should be sketched out using 
wireframes"
" These should then be reviewed by everyone involved in the web design 
and development project to make sure that they are feasible, as well as to identify 
new ideas or approaches for design and development"
 It’s much easier to change track in the planning and research phase than down the line when design and development have started
"
At the same time, consider what content you want to include on your site – will it be 
a relatively static site that doesn’t change often, or will you need an editable CMS 
to regularly add and update content, such as blog posts, images and products? 
Should the website be large enough to require it, a functional specification 
document should be created, using all the information compiled so far"
" This document details the development requirements for the website, and can be used 
to communicate any specific design constraints"
"
It’s now time to move on from planning to building"
"
Step 4: Search engine visibility
Search engine traffic is vital to a website; without it, chances are that the site will 
never fulfil its marketing functions"
" It is essential that the search engines can see 
the entire publicly visible website, index it fully, and consider it relevant for its 
chosen keywords"
"
Search engine optimisation (SEO) has its own chapter in this textbook, but here are 
the key considerations when it comes to web development and design"
"
The Writing for Digital and Search Engine Optimisation chapters provide details on 
writing copy for online use and for SEO benefit"
" When it comes to web development, 
the copy that is shown on the web page needs to be kept separate from the code 
that tells the browser how to display the web page"
" This means that the search 
engine spider will be able to discern easily what content is to be read (and therefore scanned by the spider) and what text is an instruction to the browser"
" Cascading 
style sheets (CSS) can take care of that"
"
 The following text styles cannot be indexed fully by search engines:
• Text embedded in a Java Applet or a Macromedia Flash File
• Text in an image file (that’s why you need descriptive alt tags and title attributes)
• Text accessible only after submitting a form, logging in, etc"
"
• Text accessible only after JavaScript on the page has executed
If the search engine cannot see the text on the page, it means that it cannot crawl 
and index that page"
"Step 5: Design
Design happens before development"
" According to the steps explained earlier in this chapter, the designer will transform the wireframes and basic planning 
materials into beautifully designed layouts – these are static images that show 
how the website will look once it’s coded"
"
Step 6: Development
The development phase usually kicks in once the design is finished, although developers will sometimes start their involvement as early as the wireframe stage 
by creating low-fidelity prototypes to support the user-testing process"
" Normally, 
the developer uses the design templates to code the actual website, using the front-end language that you have chosen"
 Server-side development and CMS considerations may also be part of this phase
" 
Step 7: Testing and launch
Having planned an amazing site, designed it beautifully, built it skilfully and filled it with fantastic copy, it’s time to test it fully and then take it live!
Testing is an important part of website development and design, and it should take 
place throughout the process of planning, designing and building, leaving just final quality assurance (QA) testing before the site goes live"
" Test subjects should be 
real potential users of the website, not just members of the development team!
The site needs to be tested in all common browsers to make sure that it looks and 
works as it should across all of them"
" All links should be tested to make sure that 
they work correctly, and it’s always a good idea to get a final check of all the copy before it goes live"
"
Tools such as W3C’s HTML validator (validator"
w3
"org) should be used to validate 
your HTML"
" 
Make sure your web analytics tracking tags are in place, after which it will be time 
to take your site live"
" Now, you need to move on to driving traffic to your newly 
launched site – that’s where all the Engage tactics in this textbook come in handy"

"2 The problem
 
The Boston Globe is an American daily newspaper and needed a website that would be viewable 
and usable on a range of devices"
" They turned to Upstatement, editorial designers who specialise 
in websites and applications, to assist them in solving this problem (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
6"
7
"3 The solution
 
Upstatement decided to build a responsive site for Boston Globe, to cater to all the devices on 
which their target market would be viewing the site"
" 
Before this website could be built, there were some key decisions that needed to be made"
" Among 
a few other considerations, the project leaders needed to establish the various breakpoints"
" 
Breakpoints are the points at which the device screen is too narrow or wide to display the site 
optimally"
" Once identified, the elements that needed to change at each of these breakpoints could be accounted for and a smooth user experience could be created (Bottitta, 2012)"
"
 
Which breakpoints and screen widths to design for
Upstatement had some big questions to answer before they could start the design process"
" Some 
of these were:
• What are the key breakpoints? 
• What do major templates look like at each breakpoint? 
• What do the header and footer look like? 
• What content appears on the home page, various section fronts, and article page? 
• What’s the overall look and feel? (Bottitta, 2012)
In order to identify the breakpoints, a variety of available devices were looked at: PCs, laptops, 
tablets, smartphones and dumb phones were among these"
  Upstatement identified six breakpoints
" 
Some of these were specifically for smartphones and the iPad (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
The following breakpoints were selected:
• 1 200px
• 960px
• 768px 
• 600px 
• 480px 
• 320px
Key pages were then designed to accommodate these different widths (Bottitta, 2012)"
"  The process
Designing with mobile in mind first is a well-supported school of thought, but this team designed 
with the desktop in mind first, at least for the design phase"
" They found it easier to design this way 
since most content fits in the desktop version"
 The design was then simplified for smaller screens
" 
In the coding stage, the mobile first approach was used"
" They found this worked well and used it in their subsequent projects (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
Designing for desktop is the most complex, since most elements are included, but it is also 
easier to design for, since the elements are all likely to fit in"
" Different breakpoints were looked at 
throughout the design process, with the mobile breakpoints providing the greatest insight"
" Given the limited screen size provided by mobile phones, tough decisions had to be made about which elements were the most important to display"
" Simplicity was a key theme in this design process, 
with the question constantly asked being, ‘what’s absolutely necessary and how I can simplify?’ 
(Bottitta, 2012)"
"
 
Which elements need to change to accommodate the next breakpoint?
In order to illustrate some of the decisions made in this process, the design of the header element 
of the The Boston Globe website will be discussed in more detail"
"  Above the navigation bar, the 
logo, search bar and weather information needed to be displayed"
" The user’s account information 
also needed to be accessed here"
" Another important element was ‘My Saved List’, where users could ‘bookmark’ site contents (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
 
Designing for 960px
Once the design elements were determined, all the header elements fitted well for this breakpoint 
and scaled to the larger screen size of 1 200px"
" A large dropdown enabled each subsection to be 
included, where top stories and subcategories could easily be found (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
Figure 11"

Web Development and Design  ›  Case study – The Boston Globe Web Development and Design  ›  Case study – The Boston Globe"
"160 161Designing for 768px
When designing for the smaller screen size of 768px, header elements that had previously fitted 
no longer did"
"  To solve this, they looked at what could be excluded"
" ‘Home’ couldn’t be excluded, 
and menu items couldn’t be shortened and stay meaningful (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
As a solution, ‘My Saved List’ was moved from the navigation to save space (Bottitta, 2012)"
"
Figure 12"
 BostonGlobe

"
 
Designing for 600px
Once again, fewer elements fit in at this breakpoint"
" The large dropdown was the first element to 
be excluded "
" Search, however, is a key element and had to remain, while individual sections were 
slotted into a section called ‘Sections’"
" ‘Today’s Paper’ and ‘My Saved List’, although also sections, 
were important enough to promote individually and so kept their spots (Bottitta, 2012)"
"
Figure 13"
 BostonGlobe
com at a 600px screen size
"
 
Designing for 480px
This breakpoint signified the first significant design change to accommodate the mobile landscape 
view"
" To accommodate all the elements in this view, the weather was positioned above the logo"
" 
This was done to ensure that there was space for the other website elements on the home screen"
" The ‘Today’s Paper’ section was included in the ‘Sections’ dropdown to save space, and the search 
box became an icon which expands to an input box when the user needs it (Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
Figure 14"
 BostonGlobe

"
 
Designing for 320px
With more vertical space in this view, the weather, logo and navigation bar all appear underneath 
each other"
"  Things were also simplified through code, with all the menus using the same style 
(Bottitta, 2012)"
" 
Figure 15"

What do we need to solve in the coding process?
Not all screen needs and interactive states can be planned out in the design process"
" In the coding 
process these gaps need to be filled in"
 It is also faster to solve some problems in the coding stage
" 
For this reason it’s beneficial to start coding when the major design decisions have been made 
(Bottitta, 2012)"

"8 The bigger picture
 
Web development and design can be seen as the thread that holds digital marketing together"
" 
After all, websites are the first thing we think of when talking about the Internet"
" 
With the crucial role that search engines play in the way in which people explore the Internet, web 
development and design go hand in hand with SEO"
" And, of course, online advertising campaigns, 
social media channels, email marketing newsletters and even affiliate programs lead people to 
click through to your website, and sometimes to a customised landing page"
" That’s the web design 
jumping into the mix again"
"
Setting up analytics correctly on your website is also essential to managing and monitoring your 
marketing success"
"
Successful website development and design is all about the right preparation, and the resulting 
website usually forms the foundation of any digital marketing to follow"
" Make sure you understand your users’ needs, and you’re building on a strong base"
"
 6"
"9 Summary
 
Successful websites come from strong planning with a focus on user needs"
" Websites should be built to be accessible and usable, search engine optimised and shareable"
"
Key considerations include:
• Designing your website according to best practices following the process of getting a 
website developed from start to finish
• Developing a strong, stable and usable website
• Creating a suitable mobile web experience for your users
• Enhancing user experience through design and guiding a visitor seamlessly through a website, as opposed to distracting visitors from their goals
• Ensuring consistency in visual messaging across all properties
• Supporting a wide range of web browsers and mobile devices

"1 Introduction 
Online copy is a hardworking multi-tasker "
" It must provide information to visitors, 
engage with them, convince them to take a desired action and, all the while, convey 
brand ethos"
 It also has to provide context and relevance to search engines
" It 
needs to achieve all this without making it look as if the author is trying too hard"
" 
You will see in this chapter that writing for digital is different from writing for 
more traditional media"
" Because of the sheer volume of information on the Internet, quality content is king – many people argue that it is one of the most 
significant determinants of the success of your online campaigns"

it is one of the most direct lines of communication with your consumers, this is not surprising"
" Therefore, you will see many links between this chapter and the chapter on Content Marketing Strategy"
"
Online copywriting involves everything from the text on a website to the subject 
line of an email, and all things in between"
" From PR articles of 800 words to four-
line search adverts, if it’s being read on a screen, it’s online copy"
" 
Writing for digital does not mean the traditional rules of writing need to be 
abandoned"
" By and large, the foundations remain"
" 
 
In this chapter, you will learn:
• The principles of writing for your web audience
• Which types of web copy are available to you
• The basics of HTML for formatting online text

One of the assumptions you can make about writing is that it is done for an 
audience"
" In marketing and advertising, knowing your audience is vital: it will 
guide you in developing your content strategy, determining the topics they are interested in, and help you organise information in a way that makes sense to 
them"
 It will direct how you express your copy for your audience
" NOTE

the Content Marketing 
Strategy chapter"
Writing for Digital  ›  Key terms and concepts Writing for Digital  ›  Introduction
"168 169Ultimately, understanding who you are writing for will ensure that you are able 
to communicate your message to them and thereby increase the likelihood that 
your copy will achieve the desired result"
"  
Step one of writing for digital is to ensure you have researched your audience and 
understand what they want"
" Once you have a clear idea about this, you can figure 
out how to fulfil those needs using your copy"
"  
Holly Buchanan of Future Now (Buchanan, 2008) summarises this with three 
questions you should ask:
1"
" Who is my audience?
2"
" What actions do I want them to take?
3"
" What information do they need in order to feel confident taking action?
 
When you are researching your audience, there are two useful concepts to bear in mind: the audience of one, and personas"
" 
7"
3
"1 The audience of one
According to Price and Price, audiences were traditionally thought of as a vast and vaguely defined crowd (Price & Price, 2002)"
" Because the web provides a voice to 
individuals and niche groups, the concept of this mass audience is disintegrating"
" 
Price and Price go on to argue that the Internet has led to an audience of one 
(Price & Price, 2002)"
" What does this mean? While your audience is not literally 
one person (and if it is, thank your mum for reading your copy, but spend some time growing your readership), it is not a vast, vaguely defined crowd either "
" 
Instead, the web has many niche audiences who are used to being addressed as 
individuals"
"
When you are writing marketing material, you need to identify that ‘individual’, 
investigate what he or she wants, and write as if you are speaking directly to him or her "
" The individual that you have in mind when you are writing could also be 
called a persona"
"
7"
3
"2 Personas
A persona is a profile that a writer creates to embody the characteristics of the target audience for whom he or she is writing"
" 
Personas are based on the profile of readers of your copy"
" Creating a profile is 
all about considering the characteristics of your readers and their needs and desires"
" When you are building this profile, there are a number of things that you 
should consider about your audience: 
• Are they primarily male, female or a mixture?
• How old are they?
• What are their other demographics and psychographics? 
Once you understand these simple characteristics, you can ask yourself some 
more in-depth questions"
" If you are selling something, questions include:
• How do they make purchasing decisions?
• Do they compare many service providers before selecting one?
• Do they make lists of questions and call in for assistance with decision 
making, or do they make purchase decisions spontaneously based on a special offer?
Figure 1"
 A sample persona
" (Source: UXmag)
Understanding the reader profiles of your readers is an important process, and 
the best copy usually results from extensive time spent figuring out your audience"
" 
Tailoring your copy to your audience does not necessarily limit you to one persona"
" 
Digital copy can be structured so that it caters for several personas"
" Also consider 
Writing for Digital  ›  Writing for your audience Writing for Digital  ›  Writing for your audience"
"170 171that your various marketing channels may have different audiences, so ensure that 
you have a persona for each main platform you use"
" However, you need to spend 
time understanding their needs before you are able to write copy that addresses 
these personas"
"

"4 Types of web copy
 
Whether it is long or short, the purpose of content is to communicate a message"
" 
Communication implies that the message has been both received and understood"
"  
The considerations covered here are aimed at ensuring that when you distribute a 
message, it is communicated effectively to the people who need to receive it"
" 
In order to communicate the intended message effectively, content needs to be:
• Clear and concise
• Easy to read
• Well written 
• Well structured
Content written for the web can be divided into two broad categories: short copy 
and long copy"
 The division is by no means scientific
"
7"

"1 Short copy
 
On the web, writers often have very little time and space to get a message across to a visitor, and entice them to take action"
" This is especially true of banner and 
search adverts, but is also important across all digital marketing disciplines"
" 
Probably the most important short copy anywhere is the Call to Action"
"
Call to Action
Users scan web pages and look for clues on what to do"
 Tell them
" A Call to Action is a short, descriptive instruction that explicitly tells a reader what to do (for 
example, ‘Click here’ or ‘Buy this now’)"
" Any time there is an action you want a 
reader to take, a Call to Action should instruct them on what to do"
" This means using active verbs when you write, and crafting hyperlinks to be clear instructions that resonate with your visitors at each step in the conversion process"
"
Banner advertising involves clear Calls to Action, and they can also be used in 
social media posts, search adverts, content marketing and more"
" Call to Action 
copy is not limited to short copy: email newsletters and promotions should also 
make use of Calls to Action, and we even see them all over web pages"
Figure 2
 CTAs should be clear and enticing
"
A good Call to Action resonates with the action the visitor needs to take, as opposed 
to the technical function that is performed"
" For example, if a user has entered an email address to sign up to your email newsletter, the action button should say ‘Sign up’ and not ‘Submit’"
"
Also consider what actions mean offline"
" For an email newsletter, ‘Sign up’ can 
have very different connotations from ‘Subscribe’"
" Furthermore, ‘Subscribe’ is 
very different from ‘Subscribe for free’"
" Whereas subscriptions have connotations of costs, ‘Sign up’ does not carry the same burden"
" However, ‘Subscribe for free’ could imply greater value – something that would normally carry a cost is available 
to you for free"
"
Figure 3"
 Good CTAs are short and to the point
"
Writing for Digital  ›  Types of web copy Writing for Digital  ›  Writing for your audience
NOTE
Since the Call to Action 
is key to converting customers, this is an important element to test"
 What iterations of your main Call to Action could you try?
"172 173Titles and subject lines
Titles and subject lines often form part of a body of long copy"
" However, they are 
important enough to be discussed as stand-alone short copy"
" Titles and subject 
lines are there for a very important reason: they tell a reader whether or not they 
should read further"
 They are the gateway to your content
"
Consider the following titles:
• Guide to online copywriting
• Ten steps to online copywriting that sells
The second title conveys more information and excitement to the reader, which 
helps the reader to make a decision to read further"
"
Subject lines are like headlines for emails, and can make the difference between 
an email being deleted instantly and being opened and read"
" As with a headline, 
which should be carefully crafted like the headline of a newspaper, use the subject line to make it clear what the email is about"
" For example, if there is a promotion in the email, consider putting it in the subject line as well"
"
Figure 4"
" A direct, enticing email subject line"
"
Titles, headlines and subject lines need to be both persuasive and enticing"
" 
Consider what need your copy is meeting for your readers, and express that first"
"
Search adverts
Search adverts have very limited space and time to get a message across, as well as plenty of competition for a reader’s attention"
" These four lines of copy need to 
work hard to ensure a top return on investment"
"Search adverts typically follow the same basic structure and have strict character 
limits for each line:
Heading  (max"
" 25 characters)
Two lines of advert copy,  (max"
" 35 characters)
Which can be displayed on one line"
  (max
" 35 characters)
www"
DisplayURL
com (max
" 35 characters)
With a limited character count, it can seem daunting to communicate information that entices the right people to click through, and differentiates you from your competition"
" Testing variations of copy is the best way to determine what works 
best for your campaign"
" While copywriters are not generally responsible for 
writing paid search ads, they are often brand custodians and should review all copy representing a brand"
"
Social copy
Social media allows brands to have conversations with their customers and fans"
 This gives consumers a powerful voice and the ability to tell brands what they want
" 
There are a few considerations to keep in mind when creating content for social 
media:
• Research is vital"
" Understand what type of content community members 
want"
 Meaningful and relevant content is more likely to be shared
" 
• Remember that it’s a conversation"
 Your content must be personable and appealing
" Use personality and convey the humanity of your brand in 
order to generate conversation and encourage comments"
"
• Write shareable content"
 Offer value and be insightful
" Ultimately you 
should aim to create an overall perception that your brand is the thought 
leader in its industry"
 Shareable content is credible content
"
• Avoid overly promotional content"
" Community members are likely to see 
right through a sales pitch"
"
• Have a solid communication protocol"
" These can be internal guidelines 
for organisations to follow on how they use and communicate on social media platforms"

"2 Long copy 
 
Online copywriting is not just about short, sharp Calls to Action and attention-
grabbing headlines and adverts – it also covers longer pieces of content"
" 
Longer copy has advantages"
" Primarily, it allows you to provide more information 
and encourage the reader to convert"
" You can foster a relationship with a reader, 
whether it is on a blog, through email communications, or through articles and 
news releases"
" With more words and space available, you are able to build a voice and a personality into your writing"
"
The expression ‘long copy’ is somewhat misleading"
" As online readers behave 
slightly differently from offline readers, it is unlikely that a skilled copywriter will 
be called on to create copy for the web that is longer than 800 or 1 000 words per 
page (although, of course, there are exceptions to this)"
"
Long copy needs to be structured and formatted so that it’s easy for attention-
starved web readers to digest"
 Web users tend to scan pages quickly to determine whether or not they will read further
" Specifically in longer copy, you need to take 
this into consideration"
There are many types of long online copy
" Here, we will focus on a few that are useful for marketing:
• News releases
• Articles for online syndication 
• Emails
• Blog posts 
• Advertorials
• Website 
Bear in mind that this is by no means an exhaustive list"
"
News releases
The news release is a staple of public relations"
" As the Internet grows, so does the 
overlap between PR and marketing"
" As a result, many copywriters are called upon 
to write news releases for online distribution as this is a standardised format for 
releasing information"
" Originally intended to provide information for journalists, news releases are increasingly being read without going through the journalists first"
" This means that they should be written in the brand tone, be accessible to 
the general public, and be optimised and formatted according to the principles of 
good web writing (more on those later)"
 Also remember to focus on a compelling headline to win over your reader
"
Figure 6"
 An online press release from Apple
"
Articles for online syndication
Online article syndication involves writing articles that are in no way a direct 
promotion of your brand"
" In other words, they are not press releases"
" These 
articles are written to provide information and valuable content to readers about 
something which is indirectly related to your product or service"

"176 177For example, a hotel management company could write articles about travel tips 
and advice, while a pet food seller could create content around ways to keep pets 
healthy and happy"
"
Articles are submitted to online article directories, from where they are picked up 
and republished on other sites"
" 
As the articles contain links and key phrases relevant to your site, the benefits for 
SEO can be excellent"
" But the strategy won’t work unless people want to read your articles – so they need to be interesting, informative, and not just thinly disguised adverts"
" You are aiming to inform your audience, position your brand as an expert 
in your field and demonstrate authority and thought leadership"
" While this practice 
is not as widely used as it once was, a well-executed online article syndication strategy can still yield results"
"

Emails
Email as a channel is an integral part of many online marketing strategies"
" Of 
course, content is a huge part of this; it comprises the words in an email with 
which a user engages"
" By virtue of their nature, emails are the ideal medium for communicating and 
building relationships with your consumers"
 Successful email campaigns provide value to their readers
 This value can vary from campaign to campaign
" Newsletters 
can offer: 
• Humour and entertainment
• Research and insight
• Information and advice
• Promotions and special offers

"178 179Blogging
Blogs can be very successful marketing tools"
" They’re an excellent way to 
communicate with staff, investors, industry members, journalists and prospective 
customers"
" Blogging also helps to foster a community around a brand, and 
provides an opportunity to garner immediate feedback"
 This is an audience made up of players vital to the success of a company – which is why it is important to get blogging right
" A key consideration is the quality of your headlines - you have to 
convince your reader to grant you attention"

as with email marketing, lies in the content"
" This communication channel provides 
an opportunity for you to foster an online identity for your brand as well as giving 
your company a voice and a personality"
 This happens through the content you distribute as well as the tone you use to converse with your readers
 There is more information on blogging in the chapter on Social Media Channels
"Website copy
Digital copywriters need to structure content effectively so that users want to engage on the site and read on"
" Some ways to create digital copy that is usable and 
appropriate for an online audience include: 
• Writing text that can be easily scanned"
"
• Using meaningful headings and sub-headings"
"
• Highlighting or bolding key phrases and words"
"
• Using bulleted lists"
"
• Having a well-organised site"
"
• Limiting each paragraph to one main idea or topic"
 The leading sentence should give a clear indication of what the paragraph is about
" Readers 
can scan each paragraph without missing any essential information"
"
• Cutting the fluff"
" Get rid of meaningless turns of phrase and words that 
bulk up copy unnecessarily"
" 
• Removing redundancies"
" These often creep into writing by accident, but you should work to eliminate them in order to get to the point"
"
• Including multimedia wherever relevant"

"
Writing for mobile
Mobile websites differ from traditional websites for various reasons – these are 
explored in the chapter on Mobile Marketing"
" Here are some points on creating 
digital copy for mobile websites that encourages interaction and achieves marketing and business goals:
• Get to the point"
" With limited screen space, there really is no room for wordy text"
" You need to determine exactly what your message is and get to the point quickly!
• Put the important bits up front"
 This includes contact information and navigation links
" Word these clearly so that people can take the right 
action"
" 
• Condense information to its simplest form"
" But ensure that it still makes 
sense and is grammatically sound"

"5 HTML for formatting
 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it’s the foundation of documents on the web"
 HTML tags tell browsers how to present content
" HTML 
tags are written in brackets that look like arrows: < >"
"
A good digital copywriter will also be able to use basic HTML to lay out copy, 
knowing that the appearance of the page will get his or her words read"
" It should 
be easy for users to skip and skim the copy, and it should be easy for them to find the parts that are most relevant to them"
"
When writing online copy, you can use an HTML editor, where you insert the tags 
yourself, or a ‘What You See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG) editor, which works in a 
similar way to a word processor"
"
Basic HTML is not hard to use, and will help you format your content"
" Here are 
some basic HTML tags:
• To bold: <b>phrase you want to bold</b>
• To italicise: <i>phrase you want to italicise</i>
• To underline: <u>phrase you want to underline</u>
• To list: <li>lines you want to list</li>
• To create a paragraph: <p>paragraph text</p>
• To insert a line break: <br>
• To insert a link: <a href=“page url”>phrase you want to link</a>
• To insert a heading: <h1>Level one heading</h1>
• To insert a sub-heading: <h2>Level two heading</h2>
 
The tags also help search engines to identify how the content has been laid out on the page"
"
The best way to get to grips with HTML is to start using it online, where you can 
see how the tags work"

copy alike, to great effect"
"

"1 Optimising for human and machine users
 
One of the most notable differences between writing for print and writing for digital 
is that when it comes to the latter, you are writing not only for an audience, but also 
for the search engines"
" While your human audience should always be your first 
priority, your copy also needs to speak to the search engines in a language they can understand"
 This digital tactic will be covered in greater depth in the chapter on Search Engine Optimisation
" 
Optimising your copy for search engines is important because your target audience 
is likely to be using a search engine to find the products or services you are offering"
" 
If the search engine is not aware that your content can give users the answers they are looking for on a particular subject, it won’t send traffic to your website"
 Optimising your content for search is the process of telling search engines what content you are publishing
 Keywords and key phrases are an integral part of this
" 
SEO copywriters need to know how to blend keywords into their content and how to 
use them in conjunction with text formatting and meta data"
"  In addition to assisting 
you with structuring your content, these tags indicate relevance and context to 
search engines"
" Some of the tags are used by screen readers, and so they assist visitors with technical limitations to access your content"
" The meta description 
can also be used by search engines on the search engine results pages (SERPs)"
"
7"
6
"2 Key phrases
 
A keyword refers to a single word used in a search query, while a key phrase refers 
to more than one word used in the search query"
" 
Key phrase research is an important element of digital copywriting, and is covered 
in detail in the chapter on SEO"
" Having identified the themes of your web pages, 
keyword research should be used to identify what phrases your target audience 
use when searching for you"
" It is important to know what people are searching for, so that you can give them what they need"
" Once you have a good idea of the words people are using to find information online, 
you can use these phrases in your copy as a signal to search engines that your 
content is relevant to these users"
"
A good copywriter is able to weave a predetermined set of key phrases into a piece 
of copy seamlessly, so that the reader cannot detect that they have been included"
"
Each page should be optimised for a primary key phrase, and can be optimised for 
a secondary and tertiary key phrase as well"
" Usually a web page is optimised for three key phrases, but can be optimised for up to five (although only if the page 
is very long)"
" Any more than that and you are better off creating new, niche web 
pages"
"
Key phrases can be integrated into nearly every type of content that you write for 
the web"
 Below are a few places where we tend to include key phrases on our website
" 
 
Page title
The page title appears at the top of a user’s browser and should be able to tell the 
user (and the search engine spiders, of course) what the main theme of the page 
is"
 The page title is usually limited to 71 characters (including spaces)
" The key 
phrase should be used as close to the beginning of the title as possible, followed by the name of the company or website"
"
 
Page URL
The main key phrase for the page should be used whenever possible in the URL for 
the page"
" If you are using a blogging tool or content management system (CMS), 
the URL is generated from the page title, so using the key phrase in the page title 
should ensure that it is in the URL as well"
"

"
Meta description
The meta description is a short paragraph describing the page content"
" This 
summary is usually shown on the SERPs if it contains the search term, which 
means that it needs to entice users to click through with a strong CTA"
" The spiders 
use the meta description to deduce the topic of the page, so using targeted key phrases is important here"
 Copy is limited to 156 characters (including spaces)

""
"184 185Meta keywords 
Meta keywords are the list of the words and phrases that are important on a 
web page"
" Using targeted key phrases is important, but remember – no keyword 
stuffing"
 The meta keywords are limited to 200 characters (including spaces)
" 
This is, however, no longer a major source of information used by search engines (though it certainly doesn’t hurt to include these)"
" 
 
Headings and sub-headings
Spiders assign more relevance to the text used in headings, so it is important to 
use your key phrases in the headings on your page"
" It also helps to structure your 
content"
 Headings are created with HTML tags
"
Heading structures:
• <h1> Main page headings
• <h2> Sub-headings
• <h3> Information under the sub-headings
Having a good heading hierarchy is important as spiders use it to move through 
your page and understand its relevance to the search query; it also helps human 
readers to scan your page"
" 
 
On-page copy
The number of times you use the key phrases is entirely dependent on how long 
the page of copy is"
" You want to optimise the page for the key phrases without their 
use being overt"
"
For SEO effectiveness, a page of web copy should be at least 250 words long"
" On 
a 250-word page, you could use the primary and secondary key phrases several 
times (this includes use in meta data, headings, title and body copy)"
 Make sure that these integrate seamlessly into the text and that it sounds as natural as possible
"
The page should not be so long that the user needs to scroll continuously to get to 
the end of it"
" If you find the page is getting exceptionally long, consider breaking it 
into different web pages for different sections"
" In this way, you could add several 
pages of optimised copy focused on one theme, instead of one very long page"
"
 Links to your optimised page
The text used to link from one page to another is considered important by search engine spiders, so try to ensure that your key phrase is used when linking to the 
optimised page"
" The anchor text of links should include the key phrase of the page 
being linked to, and not the page being linked from"
"
Figure 12"
" Links on a web page dealing with Google Analytics
 
Images: Alt text and title tags
Alt text refers to the ‘alt’ attribute for the <img> HTML tag: this is the text that 
appears in the caption"
" It is used in HTML to attribute text to an image on a web 
page, normally to describe what an image is about and display text in instances 
where the image is unable to load"
" While this is handy for humans and aids accessibility, it is also used for another reason: search engine spiders can’t read images, but they can read the alt text"
" The image title tag shows when you hover 
with your mouse over an image (depending on your browser) and can also be read 
by the search engine spider"

"7 Best practices for online copywriting
Now that we have covered the basic theoretical principles of writing for digital, 
we need to look at the best practices to apply whenever you are writing copy for 
publication on the web"
" There are several things that you need to consider: 
1"
" Does your copy convey a creative idea?
2"
" Does the layout of your copy make it easier to read?
3"
" Is your meaning clear and direct?
4"
" Does the copy convey the features and benefits necessary to make your point (if applicable)?
5"
" Will your readers clearly understand the content of your writing?
6"
" Is the content of your message structured in a logical manner?
The rest of this chapter will be dedicated to ensuring that you have the knowledge 
and tools to answer these questions"
" Writing for Digital  ›  Best practices for online copywriting Writing for Digital  ›  SEO copywriting
NOTE
When submitting 
promotional copy to other sites that includes links back to your own website, which phrases would be most important to include in this link text?"

"1 Conceptual copywriting
 
Most of the points in this chapter have focused on the practicalities of writing 
online copy, such as getting information across and encouraging user actions and 
engagement"
"
But copy should also be creative, beautiful and thought provoking"
"
Your copy should also express an idea that grips readers"
" Conceptual copywriting 
is about making an idea memorable merely by using words to express it – the idea is central, and the words are the vehicles that convey it"
" Clever wording, smart 
ideas and thoughtful copy should make the reader pause, think, and want to 
engage more deeply with your idea"
" 
While images are often used to express powerful ideas, words can be just as 
effective"
" Consider this famous example, which demonstrates how a small change in the copy can radically affect one’s perception of an idea:
• A woman without her man is nothing"
"
• A woman: without her, man is nothing"
"
Writing conceptually means understanding who your audience is, knowing what meaning you want to convey, and then expressing this cleverly through words"
" The idea is to write so engagingly that people just can’t stop reading!
7"
7
"2 Layout and legibility
 
As we have mentioned already, readers process content differently online from the way that they read offline"
" On the web, readers tend to scan text rather than read 
every word"
"
As a result, online copy is judged at a glance, not just on content, but first and 
foremost on its layout"
" It needs to look as if it’s easy to read before a user will 
choose to read it"
"
Digital copy should be easy to scan"
" This means using:
• Clear and concise headings 
• Bulleted and numbered lists
• Short paragraphs
• Bold and italics
• Descriptive linksIt’s easy to see this in practice"
"
Before After
Tea has been drunk for thousands 
of years, and as people are growing more health conscious, tea sales are increasing"
 Personal preference plays an important role in making the perfect cup of tea
" However, using fresh water ensures maximum oxygen in the tea, and warming the teapot first is standard practice"
" Tradition dictates one teabag per person, and one for the pot"
" Tea is served with milk, lemon, honey or sugar, according to taste"
"Worldwide, tea sales are increasing as people are becoming more health conscious"
" Here are some tips on making the perfect cup of tea:
• Use fresh water (for maximum oxygen)
• Warm the teapot first
• Use one teabag per person, and one for the pot
The perfect cup of tea is based on personal preference and taste"
" Tea can be served with:
• Milk or lemon
• Honey or sugar

"3 Language 
 
The basic principles of good writing apply online, but because your audience’s 
attention is limited (and often divided), it is best to keep it simple and tailor your 
language to your audience"
" 
 
Tone 
The tone of your content should be consistent with the brand you are writing for"
" 
Brands will often have full tone-of-voice documentation – if they don’t, read some 
of the brand material to get a feel for the company’s style of communication"
" 
Compare the difference in tone in the examples below"
"
 
Example of Tone A: Investec
Since Investec was founded in South Africa in 1974, it has expanded through a 
combination of substantial organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions in South Africa, the United Kingdom and other geographies"
"
Investec’s strategic goals are motivated by the desire to develop an efficient 
and integrated business on an international scale through the active pursuit of clearly established core competencies in the group’s principal business areas 
(Investec, 2013)"
Writing for Digital  ›  Best practices for online copywriting Writing for Digital  ›  Best practices for online copywriting
"188 189Example of Tone B: Nando’s
500 000 years ago Civilisation as we know it was born"
" People have started to 
cook with fire and the idea that food is more than just nourishment"
" A community spirit is emerging as people gather together around a flame, talking, sharing 
and laughing, in wait for their meal"
"
The Mozambique community is flourishing"
" Life here revolves around early 
evening feasts about the fire"
 Everyone joins together to share good food and their heroic stories of the day! This is where the famous story of the discovery of Peri-Peri began
" It is said that a young spirited boy went exploring one day and 
returned late that night with the African Bird’s Eye Chilli"
" It had been shown to 
him by the African people who named it Pili-Pili (Nandos, 2010)"
"
 
Active voice
Grammatically speaking, people expect characters to execute actions that have an 
impact on objects or other characters"
" 
For example: The girl ate a chocolate"
" 
• The girl is the subject"
"
• Eating is the action
• The chocolate is the object that is affected by the action
This is known as the active voice"
" Unfortunately, writers often use the passive 
voice"
 This turns the object into the subject
" For example: The chocolate was eaten 
by the girl"
 The human brain automatically translates this into the format that it expects
" According to Price and Price, this adds 25% to the time required to 
understand a sentence (Price & Price, 2002)"
"
When writing for the Web, it is better to use the active voice"
"
 
Neologisms and buzzwords
Sometimes the World Wide Web is referred to as the Wild Wild Web as it is an 
environment where anything goes"
" The ever-growing numbers of social media 
participants, for example, habitually play fast and loose with grammar"
"
With new services and products being developed daily, it can feel as if the list of new 
words (and their uses) is growing faster than you can keep up with"
" Dictionaries and reference guides celebrate this regularly with a ‘word of the year’, usually one that has been in heavy use on the Internet for the three years preceding its entry into a dictionary"
"
For example, in 2005, ‘podcast’ was voted word of the year by the editors of the New 
Oxford American dictionary (Oxford University Press, n"
d
"), while ‘blog’ had its day 
in 2004 when it was declared word of the year by Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary 
(Merriam-Webster, Inc"
", n"
d
)
" The word ‘blog’ was coined in 1999 (Wikipedia, 2012)"
"
Online services can quickly become verbs in everyday language, so we talk of 
‘Googling something’ instead of ‘searching on Google’, and of ‘Facebooking someone’"
"
Always remember you are writing for your users – and talk in the same way as 
they talk"
" If your content is aimed at cutting-edge early adopters, then pepper it 
with the latest buzzwords"
" If your audience does not know the difference between Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer, then be cautious when using a word that did not exist the day before"
"
 
Features and benefits
Writing compelling copy means conveying to readers why they should perform 
an action"
" While features may seem all-important, you need to communicate the 
benefits of the features to the user"
"
• Feature: a prominent aspect of a product or service that can provide benefit to users"
 It describes what the product does
"
• Benefit: the positive outcome for a user that a feature provides"
" It can 
be the emotional component of what the user gets out of the product"
"
For example, consider a home entertainment system"
 Features could include surround sound and a large flat-screen television
 The benefit is a cinema-quality experience in your own home
"
Features and benefits are very different"
" Features are important to the company 
that provides the product or service"
" Benefits are important to those who decide to 
use the product or service"
" 
Persuasive writing makes use of features, benefits and active verbs to create 
appealing messages for your personas:
Enjoy cinema-quality movie nights in your own home with a surround-sound home 
entertainment system"
"Writing for Digital  ›  Best practices for online copywriting Writing for Digital  ›  Best practices for online copywriting
NOTE
Why would your 
audience want to buy your product or service? Put aside the features for a moment; what will compel your audience to buy on an emotional level? How does it address their wants and needs?"

"4 Logic
 
The structure of online copy can be compared closely to the structure of a 
newspaper article"
" The headline, usually containing the most important bit of 
information in a story, comes first"
" Online, visitors need to decide quickly whether 
or not to read a page"
" As a result of this, the most important information needs to be at the top"
"
Start with the summary or conclusion – the main idea of the article"
"
Figure 13"
 Information hierarchy
"
While clever word play in headings can attract some attention, these need to be 
written in line with the objective you want to achieve"
" The copy is multitasking: not 
only is it informing visitors of what to expect; it is also telling search engine spiders what the page is about"
"

"8 Tools of the trade

"1 One-line summary
 
Encyclopaedia Britannica increased sign-ups by 103% by applying web copy best practices"
"
7"
9
"2 The problem
 
Encyclopaedia Britannica is a household name, renowned for producing accurate and up-to-date 
content"
" Encyclopaedia Britannica Online is a subscription-based digital service that offers a range 
of informational tools and articles"
" The site also offers a free trial subscription that lets interested 
people try out the service before committing to a purchase"
"
The web page on which users could sign up for the free trial was performing adequately, but it was 
bogged down by structural and copy mistakes"
 The brand was not sharing a value proposition or driving users to complete the desired on-page action – signing up for the trial version
" 
7"
9
"3 The solution
 
In order to increase sign-ups, Encyclopedia Britannica completely transformed the copy on the ‘free trial’ page of the website"
" Some of the changes made included the following:
• Heading: The heading and subheading were rewritten to grab the reader and express 
the value and content of the offer"
" The heading changed from the rather generic “Why 
try Encyclopedia Britannica?” to a clear, specific offer: “Get unlimited access to all 32 
volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica during your FREE TRIAL…”
• Copy: the amount and type of copy on the page was drastically reduced"
" Rather than 
paragraphs of persuasive ‘power’ copy, the new version launched directly into the content of the offer, making clarity the guiding principle"
" 
• Benefits: Member benefits were moved from an out-of-the-way column on the left to the 
centre of the page, and were reformatted into bullet points with bolding for emphasis"
"
• Images: The old page included lots of images but none of them were specifically 
relevant to the product or offer"
 This was changed to a single large image displaying the encyclopedias and a computer screen
 The image was also given a caption that reinforced the value offering
"
• Call to Action: Several aspects of the CTA were changed to make the offer more appealing"
" 
The main button was rewritten from ‘Take a free trial’ to ‘Get instant access now’ 
(emphasising that the user would receive something rather than having to take it)"
" The 
saving was also included and highlighted in yellow to draw the reader’s eye"

Engage"
"198 199Introduction to Engage
The next few chapters deal with driving traffic to your online assets – and engaging 
this stream of potential and existing customers by building relationships with them"
" 
The beauty of the Internet is that you can track your traffic-driving campaigns and 
then use that information to measure your results, report on campaigns, and target your marketing more effectively"
"
It’s useful to consider all of these tactics in terms of their influence on the sales 
cycle"
" The sales cycle is the typical sequence of phases through which a customer 
moves"
" It’s often represented as a funnel, indicating that there are fewer consumers further along in the sales cycle – you learnt about this model in the Think section"
"
While one could argue that all channels are important at every phase of the 
purchase cycle, some are clearly more influential at specific times than others"
"
Online Advertising is the crucial first step – this is a tactic that builds awareness 
about and interest in your brand"
" Sometimes, performance marketing or Affiliate Marketing is used to drive traffic and awareness"
"
Once a potential customer knows about you, they can search for you"
" Search 
marketing, which comprises Search Engine Optimisation and Search Advertising, 
is powerful because it is closely aligned with a customer’s stated intent (in the form of a search query)"
" 
Choosing you as their preferred option often hinges on how favourably you are 
seen by others in the market"
" Being well represented on Social Media is important 
for brands marketing online, and online monitoring tools help you to understand how digital communities perceive brands"
"
Video Marketing is another excellent tool for engaging and capturing your 
audience’s attention"
"
Digital then takes it further into the realm of building relationships with customers, 
using digital channels to interact and engage with them"
" Again, social media plays 
a big role here, as do traditional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
tactics such as Email Marketing"
" 
With the explosion in web access via mobile devices, it’s important to understand 
these various channels from a mobile perspective"
" Mobile Marketing is used to create awareness, drive direct action and build relationships"
"Engage  ›  Introduction
While measurement and tracking will be discussed in each chapter, it’s worth going into the Engage chapters with an understanding of how we track, report on 
and pay for various online campaigns"
"
There are several terms you will see used throughout these chapters:
• Impression: when an advert or a piece of online content is served (and 
hopefully seen by a web user)"
"
• Interaction: when a user interacts with an advert or content, such as 
watching a video, playing a game, or leaving a comment"
"
• Click: exactly what it sounds like – when a user clicks on a link or advert"
" 
This is different from an interaction, because when a user clicks, they go 
to a different page on the web"
"
• Action: when a user completes a predetermined action, such as making a purchase, signing up to a newsletter, or downloading some content"
"
These terms are reflected in the different ways of paying for and measuring online campaigns"
 Sometimes we talk about campaigns in terms of cost per thousand impressions (CPM)
 This is when campaigns are paid for based on the number of times content has been served
" It’s a technique used frequently in online 
advertising, but is also a way of measuring social content"
"
One can also look at the cost of a user interacting with a piece of content"
" Some 
of the most successful online campaigns are run on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis, where you don’t pay for content to be served, but rather for each click on that content"
" Lastly, payment or measurement can be regarded in terms of the cost per 
action (CPA): the cost of a user taking a specific action (excellent for the advertiser 
but risky for the publisher)"
"
As you work through the following chapters, the above will be become clearer to 
you"
" 
Remember, the chapters that follow are important arrows in your digital marketing 
quiver"
" However, a strategic approach is required in order for you to determine the 
best solutions to meeting your online goals"
" You don’t need to tackle everything 
at once: focus on the foundations first, and then track and measure in order to determine which channels are working best, optimising as you go"
 And always put your audience’s needs and wants first
"NOTE
Google has some 
intriguing insights about 
the role each channel 
plays, depending on 
the industry you work

"1 Introduction
CRM – customer relationship management – has existed since people first started 
selling things"
" The first shopkeeper who stopped to chat with his customers, who 
remembered their names, and perhaps gave them a small ‘freebie’ for continually 
using his services, was practicing a form of customer relationship marketing by making customers feel special"
 He was also probably seeing the favourable impact on his bottom line
" 
Today, with businesses becoming more digitally remote, and person-to-person 
contact becoming more scarce, CRM is more important than ever"
" We need to 
build and maintain relationships with our customers"
 A faceless company is not personable or engaging - it has to work harder to fill the gap between attracting and retaining customers (and their good will)
" The relationship a customer builds 
with a company is often the reason they return – but building it today is more 
difficult than ever, in a society where data is protected, customers are smart and exercise their right to choose, and a competitor can be just a click away"
" 
CRM is a customer-focused approach to business based on fostering long-term, 
meaningful relationships"
 CRM is not about immediate profit
" It’s about the lifetime 
value of a customer – the purchases they will make in future, the positive word of

"3 A CRM model
Many companies that practice CRM rely on a simple model to guide them 
strategically – in many cases, this sums up exactly what CRM is about"
" Here is a 
simple model that demonstrates this:NOTE
Since ROI can be hard 
to establish, how 
could you go about 
convincing business 
decision makers that it’s 
important to implement 
a CRM system?"
204 205Figure 1
 A simple CRM model can provide strategic guidance
"
As you can see, a good CRM strategy turns strangers into customers, customers 
into friends, and friends into advocates for your business"
"

"4 Understanding customers
 
Customers can be seen as the most important stakeholders in a business"
" Without customers purchasing goods or services, most businesses would not have a 
revenue stream"
" But it can be difficult to shift from realising this important fact to 
implementing it in day-to-day business decisions and strategy"
"
A successful relationship with a customer is based on meeting or even exceeding 
their needs"
" It is in determining what problems the customer has, and in providing solutions, sometimes before the problem occurs"
" It depends on continually giving 
the customer a reason to transact with your company above any other"
"
CRM should not only mean implementing customer-centric processes and consider 
technology, but embracing customer-driven processes"
" Through innovations 
in digital technologies, enhanced customer engagement and the introduction of mass personalisation, the customer can often drive the business"
"

"1 Consumer touchpoints
 
Consumer touchpoints are all the points at which brands touch consumers’ lives during their relationship"
" This is the starting point for all CRM – a brand needs 
to speak with one voice across all of these touchpoints and deliver a rewarding experience every time it interacts with its customers"
" Touchpoints can be brand 
initiated (for example, a brand sending an email newsletter) or customer initiated (for example, the customer making a purchase in a store)"
" 
People don’t start out as customers; they begin as prospects – people who merely 
view a business’s offering"
" Once a prospect has expressed interest, CRM can help 
to convert them into a customer"
" Some people will always shop on price – they 
need to be converted to loyal customers"
 Here brand perception and service are often the differentiators
 Consider the prospect who walks into a car dealership and is given outstanding service
" In this case, CRM – in the form of an aware and 
trained sales force – can help turn a prospect into a customer"
" 
A consumer touchpoint can be as simple as a print or banner ad"
" It can also be as 
multifaceted as a conversation between a call centre agent and a customer"
" It can be a timely tweet, or an outbound email giving the customer details about their account"
" Even statements and bills are touchpoints – and need to be managed 
carefully to ensure that the brand continues its relationship with the customer 
successfully"
"
Customer touchpoints can generally be divided into three spheres or phases"
"
 
Pre-purchase or pre-usage covers the various ways brands and prospects interact 
before the prospect decides to conduct business with a company"
" The brand’s 
goals here are to:
• Gain customers
• Heighten brand awareness
• Shape brand perceptions – to highlight the benefits it offers over competitors
• Indicate how the brand provides value and fulfils the needs and wants of 
consumers
• Educate consumers about products and services
 
Purchase or usage covers the touchpoints at which the customer decides to 
purchase a product, use a service or convert according to set criteria, and initiates 
the brand-customer relationship"
" The key goals are to:
• Instil confidence
• Deliver value
• Reinforce the purchase decision
• Heighten brand perceptions CRM  ›  Understanding customers CRM  ›  A CRM model

"2 Customer loyalty 
 
The main objective of any CRM strategy should be to gain customer loyalty over the long term"
" But what is loyalty? This may mean different things for different 
organisations"
" Ultimately, it is about acquiring and retaining customers who:
• Have a projected lifetime value that makes them a valuable prospect to your business
• Buy a variety of your products or use your services repeatedly during their time as a customer
• Share their positive experiences with others
• Provide honest feedback on these products and services, and their experiences
• Collaborate with you on ways to improve their experiences
 
8"
"5 CRM and data
 
Data is central to the success of CRM initiatives"
" Knowing who your customer is 
and what they want makes a CRM strategy successful"
" Data gathering can begin 
even before your prospect becomes a customer"
" Matching a prospect’s profile to 
the product or offer is the first step"
" 
But data on its own is meaningless if it is not analysed and acted upon"
" Through 
analysis, data can be turned into insights, which can then inform the various CRM processes and, indeed, the business itself"
 Data should be used to drive consumer loyalty across all possible touchpoints
 Consider the consumer who shops on her store card at a retail outlet
" Her transactions are recorded against her card – she is sent offers that detail the latest 
fashion trends and earns points on her card shopping for these"
" At some point, her 
transactional data shows that she has started shopping for baby clothes – she can now be cross-sold products to do with babies, and rewarded with double points when she buys them"
" Now she is upping her spend in the store, cross-shopping 
for both herself and her family and being rewarded for this, thus ensuring that the 
retail outlet is offering her value and retaining her business"
"

"1 Customer data
 
A good CRM programme begins with data"
" Who are my customers and what do they want? Why did they choose me in the first place? How many of them are 
active, and continue doing business with me? Why do the others stop? 
Often, you will need to research this information"
" If the company has a database, 
conducting surveys, focus groups or dipstick telephonic research can help you get 
an idea"
" Consider that an Audi Q7 driver is vastly different to an Audi A1 driver, for instance"
" They both pick the brand for the same reasons, but their motivations behind choosing the products vastly differ"
"
Data can give you these insights"
" It can enable a company to create real value 
for the customer and thereby gain true loyalty"
" There is little point in running a 
customer insights survey, looking at the results and saying “that’s interesting” 
without putting into action any changes suggested by the results"
" It also means customers are less likely to take part in surveys going forward, and quite rightly so – what’s in it for them? Conversely, if you do action changes, customers will feel 
increased ownership in the brand and its offering"
" 
The actual database in which you choose to gather and collate data is also crucial"
" 
Remember that there are many facets to CRM, and the quality and accessibility of the data will have a major impact on how well these processes run"
" 
When looking at data, it is essential to keep in mind the Pareto principle"
" The 
Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, holds that in many situations approximately 80% of 
profits are delivered by 20% of customers"
" Also keep in mind that 20% of customers 
are responsible for 80% of problems related to service and supply (Koch, 2008)"
"
This means designing solutions with efforts directed at the 20% of customers who 
generate the most profits"
" To do this, you should segment customers effectively"

208 209You’ll also want to consider the exact data to collect
" While this will depend largely 
on your business objectives, here are some considerations:
• Information should be commercially relevant"
"
• Capture additional contact details from the customer at every interaction – on 
purchases, contracts, negotiations, quotes, conversations and so on"
" 
• Capture any information you send out to the customer"
"
• Consider anything that adds value to the relationship"
"
• Note any legal implications around capturing data, particularly web-based 
behavioural data, as the user’s privacy must always be taken into account"

"2 Where and how to gather CRM data
 
CRM data is gathered from a variety of touchpoints"
 Let’s look at some of the possible opportunities for CRM data capture and analysis
" Each avenue discussed 
below collects a range of data from whichever touchpoints the business deems 
valuable"
" 
Traditional CRM system data
Most traditional CRM systems are used to capture data for sales, support and marketing purposes"
" On top of simply creating a central repository for data access, 
these systems and their related databases also offer basic analytics"
" The actual 
range of data collected within the traditional CRM system is dictated by the CRM objectives"
" For instance, data could include:
• Demographic details on potential leads, current leads and contacts, such as age, gender, income, etc"
" 
• Quotes, sales, purchase orders and invoices (transactional data)
• Psychographic data on contacts such as customer values, attitudes, interests, etc"
" 
• Service and support records 
• Customer reviews or satisfaction surveys
• Web registration data 
• Shipping and fulfilment dates, such as when orders were shipped and deliveredData mining 
Data mining involves analysing data to discover unknown patterns or connections"
 It is usually conducted on large datasets and looks for patterns that are not obvious
" 
Data is analysed with statistical algorithms that look for correlations"
" It is used by 
businesses to better understand customers and their behaviour, and then to use this data to make more informed business decisions"
" For instance, women might traditionally be shopping for nappies during the week"
" But on the weekend, men 
become the primary nappy-shoppers"
" The things that they choose to purchase on 
the weekend, such as beer or chips, might dictate different product placement in 
a store over a weekend"
" 
Analytics data 
Analytics data is generally captured through specialised analytics software 
packages"
" These packages can be used to measure most, if not all, digital 
marketing campaigns"
" Web analytics should always look at the various campaigns 
being run"
" For example, generating high traffic volumes by employing CRM marketing tactics like email marketing can prove to be a pointless and costly exercise if the visitors that you drive to the site are leaving without achieving one 
(or more) of your website’s goals"
" 
Social media monitoring data
There are many social media metrics that are important to monitor, measure and 
analyse, and some of these can provide valuable insights for CRM implementation"
" 
This can cover everything from quantitative data about number of fans and 
interactions, to qualitative data about the sentiment towards your brand in the social space"
"

"3 Collating and organising your data
Typically, you’ll find that a business has:
• One or more databases – e"
g
" email, customer, mobile, or call centre databases"
"
• A point of sale system where product purchase data is stored"
"
• Various forms of web data – from display or search networks, keyword 
research, site analytics, social media or email marketing"
"
• Social media profiles on sites like Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn (which can also be considered databases of sorts)"
"CRM  ›  CRM and data CRM  ›  CRM and data
NOTE
Read more about this 
in the Data Analytics chapter"
"NOTE
Data mining is typically performed by computers, which can sift through massive amounts of data and find tiny (but significant) patterns that a human researcher may overlook"
""
"210 211CRM software can be used to automate lead and sales processes, and to collect 
all of this customer information in a centralised place, allowing a company to get 
a holistic view of the customer – from this, meaningful data insights can emerge"
" 
Organisations can be large, and a customer often speaks to several members 
of the organisation, depending on the nature of the communication"
" It would be 
extremely frustrating for the customer to have to explain all previous dealings with the organisation each time, and equally frustrating for an organisation not to know 
who has spoken previously with a customer and what was dealt with"
" This could 
be a touchpoint at which a company falls down, and leaves a less than positive impression with the customer"
"
Fortunately, there are many technological options that help to record all this 
information in one place"
" Most of these services can also schedule elements of the 
sales process, and set reminders where appropriate for follow-up action"
"
Some notable examples include SalesForce (www"

(www"

" Bespoke 
technology tailored to business problems can have remarkable results"

"4 Keeping data fresh
 
Call it what you will, but “stale”, “outdated” or “unhealthy” data doesn’t benefit anyone"
" Some generic older data can help you assess trends over time, but 
identifiable customer data is usually useless if not up to date"
" People move house, 
update their contact numbers and email addresses, change jobs"
" They earn more or less, stop working, start working, have kids, retire"
" All of these mean that their needs change, and their contactability changes, so maintaining a customer 
relationship and delivering the things they want becomes impossible"
"
So, how do you keep your data fresh?
For generic data (like web analytics), you must continuously monitor trends and 
note what causes changes over time"
" This is also useful for monitoring trends and 
identifying gaps in data when a business evolves"
" For instance, if you know that you generally receive increased website and store visits during December, but your 
sales drop, you know that you need to gather more data around your inventory and 
in-store environment during that time"
"
Keeping identifiable data current means you need to facilitate regular dialogue 
with contacts on your database"
" Whether it’s through a call centre, an online 
prompt or a quick question at your in-store point of sale, there needs to be a plan 
for updating details at regular intervals"

"5 Analysing data for marketing
 
One of the most powerful features of interactions and transactions over the Internet is that everything is tracked and recorded (see the Data Analytics and Conversion 
Optimisation chapters)"
 This provides a wealth of data that can be analysed to make business decisions
"
For CRM, this means that the customer acquisition source can be recorded and 
analysed against sales data"
 This leads to a very accurate return on investment (ROI) calculation and indicates where CRM and marketing efforts should be focused
"
ROI stands for return on investment – and it’s key to understanding whether 
marketing efforts have been successful"
" Here’s a simple example: Company A 
sells accounting software and makes R10 000 on each product it sells"
" It sends 
an email to its customer base – people who have bought a previous version of the software and might be interested in upgrading"
 The campaign has an overall cost of R100 000
" Of the 5 000 people who receive the email, 10% decide to buy"
" That 
means it cost R200 to acquire each of the 500 customers"
" The company has made 
R5 million – an ROI of 50:1"
"
The key to effective use of technology in CRM is integration"
" Ensure that all 
channels can be tracked, and that information is usable to all parties within an organisation"
" Knowing where your customers come from, but not what they 
purchase, is pointless: these two metrics need to be compared in order to produce 
actionable insights"
"
Analysing CRM data can aid marketing initiatives in a variety of ways:
• Campaign analysis – find out which marketing campaigns are leading to the 
best returns so you can refine them and increase ROI
• Personalisation – customise your communications to each customer
• Event monitoring – tie offline events, like shows or sales, to your online 
interactions and sales
• Predictive modelling – predict a customer’s future behaviour and meet this need at the right time
• Improved customer segmentation, including:
o Customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis – predicting each customer’s 
lifetime value and managing each segment appropriately (for example, 
offering special deals and discounts)CRM  ›  CRM and data CRM  ›  CRM and data
NOTE
Read more about this in 
the Optimise chapters"
"
NOTE
Mobile marketing can play a key role in offline events - after all, the mobile phone is portable and connected to the internet, meaning that people can engage with a brand directly on location"
"NOTE
Have you ever had a 
frustrating service 
experience yourself as 
a customer? How did 
you feel about the brand 
afterwards?"
"212 213o Advanced customer profiles that identify certain behaviours, such as 
big spenders or those who look for bargains by attending sales"
" This 
information can be used to tailor marketing communications accordingly
o Customer prioritisation – target small groups of customers with customised products and service offerings that are aligned to meet 
customer needs, rather than simply generic current offerings"
" You should craft specialised retention strategies for customers with the 
highest CLV
o Identifying brand influencers and advocates"
" Consider the realm of social media, where influencers are central to the spread of content"
" 
Brands are increasingly prioritising relationship building with social media influencers to build brand advocates who will help market the 
business for them"
" By identifying which customers are providing the 
most value and positively influencing others to become customers, you can focus efforts towards them and increase their loyalty, creating true brand advocates
 
Understanding customer lifetime value
CLV is the profitability of a customer over their entire relationship with the business"
" Businesses need to look at long-term customer satisfaction and 
relationship management, rather than short-term campaigns and quick wins 
– this approach leads to increased value over the entire lifetime of a customer and means that CLV is a metric central to any CRM initiative"
" 
It’s important to look at your customer base and segment them according to 
how often they purchase and how much they spend with your company"
" Very 
often, customers who spend more cost more to acquire, but they might also 
stay with the company for longer"
 Referrals made by a customer can also be included as part of the revenue generated by the customer
"
The key is to understand these costs and then target your CRM strategies 
appropriately"
" CLV lets you decide what a particular type of customer is really 
worth to your business, and then lets you decide how much you are willing to 
spend to win or retain them"
"
For example, a potential customer looking to purchase a digital camera is likely 
to search on Google for cameras"
" As a company selling digital cameras, your 
excellent search advert and compelling offer attract the potential customer, 
who clicks through to your website"
" Impressed with your product offering, the user purchases a camera from you, and signs up to your email newsletter as part of the payment process"
"Analysing the amount spent on your search campaign against the sales 
attributed to the campaign will give the cost per acquisition of each sale"
" In this 
case, this is the cost of acquiring the new customer"
"
As the user’s now signed up to your newsletter, each month you send her 
compelling information about products she might be interested in"
" These newsletters could be focused on her obvious interest in photography, and 
highlight additional products she can use with her new camera"
" The costs 
associated with sending these emails are the costs of maintaining the relationship with the customer"
" When she purchases from you again, these costs can be measured against the repeat sales likely to be made over the 
course of the customer’s lifetime"
" 
Assuming that a customer buys a new camera every three years, moves up 
from a basic model to a more expensive model, perhaps buys a video recorder at a certain point – all of these allow a company to calculate a lifetime value and ensure that their spending on a particular customer is justified"
"
CRM loyalty programs
There is a difference between CRM and loyalty programmes – often loyalty programmes actively seek to maintain customers by rewarding them with a 
hard currency, like points"
" Loyalty programmes are designed to develop and 
maintain customer relationships over a sustained period of time by rewarding 
them for every interaction with the brand – for instance, you may earn points on a purchase, for shopping on certain days, completing a survey, or choosing to 
receive a statement by email"
" 
Consider health insurer Discovery and their Vitality program: it aims to keep 
customers healthy by rewarding them for health-related behaviours like exercising, having regular check-ups, stopping smoking and buying fresh foods"
" By doing so, it reduces the burden of ill-heath on the medical aid itself"
" 
Not all loyalty programmes are created equal"
" Many brands have embraced them 
as a way to improve their sales, and consumers have come to believe that they are 
simply a way of extorting more money from them"
" 
To create an effective loyalty programme, consider the following:
• Carefully calculate the earning and redemption rates of points – a loyalty 
programme needs to give the appearance of real value, while working within 
the company’s profit projections
• Loyalty programmes are about engagement – you need to find a way to partner with the customerCRM  ›  CRM and data CRM  ›  CRM and data
NOTE
The reward you offer 
must be meaningful, relevant and valuable - in other words, something the customer really wants"
" They should also be exclusive to members of the loyalty programme, making them feel appreciated"
""
"214 215• Rewards are key to success – you need to reward the customer in a way 
that is real and desirable
• Customer care is important – technology allows for effective real-time 
conversations
• Data is central to success – you need to maintain accurate records in one 
central place
• Digital allows for innovation – this can apply to new payment technology, digital communications channels and more
• Trust is pivotal to success – customers need to know that their data is being 
protected and that you will honour your commitments
• Loyalty programmes are not quick wins – consider up-front how the programme might come to a close or you risk alienating and disappointing customers and undoing any positive results

"6 The benefits of CRM
 
At its core, effective CRM promises the following:
• Increased revenue and profitability 
• Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty
• Improved service delivery and operational efficiencies
• Decreased acquisition costs – keeping churn low through CRM offsets the need to spend as much on acquisition of new clients, while retention of existing ones is cheaper for obvious reasons
Maintaining good customer relationships is critical to the success of a business"
 The cost associated with acquiring a new customer is generally far higher than the cost of maintaining an existing customer relationship
" While an investment in 
a CRM communication programme or platform can be large, these costs are often 
offset over the increased revenue generated by encouraging repeat business"
"
8"

"1 Putting a value on CRM
 
Broadly, CRM can be looked at from:
• A marketing perspective – increasing the number of people who know about your service or product • A cost perspective – decreasing the amount you spend on customers; it 
costs more to attract a new customer than maintain an existing one
• A sales perspective – turning the people who know about your service or 
product into people who have made a purchase 
• A service perspective – ensuring people who have interacted with you are 
satisfied and delighted"
"
Effective CRM can also create a powerful new marketing and referral force for a company: its happy customers"
" Delighting customers fosters positive word of 
mouth"
"
The first step to any CRM initiative is to understand the value of a customer 
relationship to a business"

"7 Social CRM
 
Widespread social media usage means that CRM has to be conducted in this forum in order to deliver an all-round experience for the customer"
" Not only should social 
media be integrated into any existing CRM strategy and looked at from a touchpoint 
and channel perspective, but social media can also be used to drive CRM"
" 
CRM should embrace the social customer – effectively summed up by social CRM 
expert Paul Greenberg as follows:
“Social customers are not the customers of yore"
" They trust their peers, are connected 
via the web and mobile devices to those peers as much of a day as they would like"
" They expect information to be available to them on demand … They require transparency 
and authenticity from their peers and the companies they choose to deal with” 
(Greenberg, 2010)"
"
Social media platforms allow customers to easily share their brand experience 
(good or bad) with their online social connections, who in turn can share this experience on"
" This means a potential word-of-mouth audience of millions 
could witness a single user’s brand experience and weigh in on the situation"
" 
Social customers place a great deal of value on the opinions of their peers, and are more likely to look favourably on a brand, product or service if a peer has 
recommended or praised it"
" In fact, the 2012 Edelman Trust Barometer, an annual 
trust and credibility survey, saw trust in social media increase by 75%, noting that respondents are placing more and more importance on information gathered from this space (Edelman, 2012)"
" 
Brands have realised that they need to leverage this in their CRM strategies and 
now understand that communication is not one way (from brand to consumer), 
or even two way (between consumer and brand) but multi-directional (brand to 
consumer, consumer to brand, consumer to consumer)"

"1 Social CRM and support
 
Social customers are increasingly turning to social media channels for support"
" With the immediate accessibility offered through mobile devices, they see this as 
a convenient channel to communicate with brands"
" This means that brands need 
to respond quickly and transparently to consumers’ questions, gripes and even compliments"
" A support query going unanswered on Twitter, for instance, is likely to cause frustration for the consumer, and prompt them to take a situation that is 
already visible to other consumers even further, potentially causing a brand crisis"

"218 219Brands should carefully consider whether all social media channels are 
appropriate for them, and be prepared for any eventuality"
" Brands that are well 
liked will generally have positive responses on social media, those that receive 
a mediocre response from consumers will have a bit of a mixed bag, but those that have a lot of support issues are likely to experience very large numbers of complaints that need to be addressed"
" 
Social support staff should have access to all the historical data relating to 
customer issues – such as all the data collected about previous complaints and 
reference numbers"

" Online monitoring, or reputation management, entails knowing what is being 
said about your organisation and ensuring that you are leading the conversation"
" 
By using these tools, brands can rate and sort these mentions based on their 
sentiment"
" This allows them to effectively test the temperature of the online 
community’s feeling towards the brand, which can then guide any future action"
"

3 Customer-centric vs
" customer-driven 
organisations
 
Effective CRM places the customer’s needs first in all dealings with the brand"
" 
However, there is a vast difference between a customer-centric organisation and 
a customer-driven one"
" 
Placing the customer at the centre of an organisation’s business planning and 
execution is different to having customers drive the direction of a business"
" Many 
new, web-based businesses rely on the latter, and actively encourage customers to take the lead and add value to the business"
" 
Services such as Flickr (www"
flickr
com) and Twitter (www
twitter
"com) are user-
driven rather than user-centric"
" They provide tools that enable users to make the 
service their own, often by allowing outside developers to create supplementary 
services"
" So, Flickr users can export their images and use them to make custom 
business cards on Moo (www"
moo
com)
" There are many auxiliary services 
based on Twitter such as analysis services (www"
klout
"com) and access services 
 
(www"
twhirl
org)
" Savvy organisations can also provide tools to customers to drive their business, passing on tasks to customers that might ordinarily have been performed by the organisation"
" For example, many airlines now allow travellers to check in online prior to arriving at the airport"
" As more travellers elect to check themselves in, 
staff costs for airlines can be reduced"
" The travellers are doing the job for free (and 
are getting a better experience too)"
"
Figure 2"
" A CRM email reminder to check in for a flight, from airline EasyJet"
"
Customer-centric strategy, on the other hand, uses data to present the best 
possible experience to the customer"
" Amazon’s collaborative filtering is an 
example of a customer-centric approach"
" Using customer data, Amazon will share 
products that you are more likely to prefer"
"
Figure 3"
" Amazon provides recommendations based on what customers with similar 
profiles are looking at"

"8 Step-by-step guide to implementing a 
CRM strategy
8"

"1 Step 1 – Conduct a business needs analysis
 
A major part of determining where to begin with a CRM implementation is having 
a clear understanding of the business needs, and where CRM would most benefit 
the organisation"
" CRM touches on sales, marketing, customer service and support 
both online and offline"
 It’s important to review the needs of each business area so that you can determine your strategy for CRM
" 
Ideally you should have individual goals for each department – and all members 
within the organisation should buy in to the strategy in order to drive it successfully, 
from the highest rank to the lowest"
" Implementing successful CRM across the 
organisation is a process, with stakeholders making decisions collectively and sharing their views and needs"
 Decisions should be based on realistic budgets and resources and full calculations carried out before any kind of loyalty currency is decided upon
" 
8"
8
"2 Step 2 – Understand customer needs
 
CRM is about the customer"
" You might have identified a range of business needs, but what about the needs of the customer?
Two elements of CRM in particular – service delivery and customer support – are 
actually all about meeting the needs of the customer"
" And what’s the best way of 
determining customer needs? By asking them, of course"
" There are various ways 
to find out what customers want, but in all of them, it is important to listen"
" Use online monitoring tools and insights from social media to gather a more rounded 
view of what your customers think, feel and want"
" Look at past behaviour, churn 
rates, successes – a detailed data mining exercise could also be on the cards, as you will need to understand which of your customers is the most valuable and why"
8
8
"3 Step 3 – Set objectives and measurements of 
success
 
CRM is a long-term commitment and you need to consider a long-term approach"
" 
Depending on the business needs, your objectives and success measures could 
include:
• Increasing customer numbers
• Increasing profitability per customer
• Increasing market share
• Improving responses to campaigns
• Raising customer satisfaction 
• Improving end-to-end integration of the sales process cycle
 
The metrics you select for measurement will depend on these objectives"
" 
There are numerous metrics that you can choose from when measuring your 
performance, and the actual metrics you choose are generally referred to as your 
key performance indicators (KPIs)"
"
8"
8
"4 Step 4 – Determine how you will implement CRM
 
Once you’ve identified all of the objectives of your CRM implementation, you will need to determine how you are actually going to roll it out"
" What channels will 
you use? What touchpoints will you leverage? What data will you need for this? 
And what tools will you need to gather this data and implement your initiatives across these channels? How will you address the shift and communicate with your internal stakeholders before you launch the initiative to your external ones?
You will need to make choices based on what is available to you, or what you intend 
on embracing"
" The digital space offers a range of innovative spaces for CRM 
delivery; you simply need to get creative in your execution"
"
8"
8
"5 Step 5 – Choose the right tools
 
There are lots of excellent CRM tools available, but these are useless without a clear CRM strategy in place"
" You can only select your tools once you know what 
your objectives are, what touchpoints and channels you are going to utilise and 
what data you need to collect and analyse"

"9 Tools of the trade
Collaborative CRM tools
Collaborative CRM refers to a process that combines customer data across all 
facets of a company"
" For example, queries regularly submitted to the technical 
support or customer service arm of a business can be used to inform product 
development and website content"
" Instead of various departments collecting their own customer data and using this in isolation, data is collated so that all channels make informed decisions based on the holistic customer experience"
" 
MindTouch (www"
mindtouch
"com) is an example of a CRM product that offers 
collaborative authoring"
" This means that multiple users can simultaneously edit 
shared documents while maintaining an audit trail and version control"
"
Social CRM tools 
Social CRM tools perform a number of functions, from standardising the collection of data from social media channels to automatically posting links and accepting 
friend requests"
" These tools can also be used to identify customer sentiment 
within social media channels"
"
BrandsEye (www"
brandseye
"com), Radian6 (www"
radian6
"com) and Simplify360 
(www"
simplify360
"com) are examples of social CRM listening tools that collect data on brand mentions across social media channels online, in real time"
" 
Operational CRM tools
Operational CRM tools deal with the most obvious channels that relate to 
customers: the front end of a business and its customer service"
" From a web 
technology point of view, operational CRM informs the website a customer sees as well as their entire online user experience"
" 
Two examples of operational CRM tools are OnContact (www"
oncontact
"com) and 
Zoho CRM (www"
zoho
com/crm)
"
Sales and marketing automation CRM tools
Sales force automation uses CRM software to manage sales cycles and to collect customer sales data"
" The software enables businesses to track leads, schedule transactions and communications with potential and existing customers, and generate detailed reporting on the sales process"
" 
Marketing automation tools identify current customers and use their response 
information to manage email marketing lists"
" The tools can also identify prospects, 
as well as unhappy customers"
"
HubSpot (www"
hubspot
"com) offers a marketing automation tool that allows 
companies to generate and send behaviour-driven emails"
"
Analytical CRM tools
Analytical CRM tools allow companies to record , save and investigate customer 
data to better understand customers through their behaviour"
" For instance, data 
collected about the nature of visits to your website can be used to make informed 
decisions about where to focus attention based on customer behaviour"
 Past purchasing behaviour of customers can be analysed to predict future purchasing behaviour
 Data can be used to segment customers and tailor communications
"
These tools can help target marketing campaigns at customers and predict future 
sales and customer spending"
" 
KXEN (www"

"2 The problem
 
Due to organisational growth and an increase in services offered, Fuji Xerox Thailand needed to find a more efficient way to gather and store customer data"
" The company was also under 
pressure to provide better business forecasting, which relied heavily on their ability to analyse 
accurate customer data (Sundae Solutions, 2012)"
"CRM  ›  Case study: Fuji Xerox CRM  ›  Step-by-step guide to implementing a CRM strategy
NOTE
Data can tell you what 
your customers are doing - it’s your job to investigate this and to determine why "
""
"224 225To achieve this, they decided to invest in a CRM system that would allow them to centrally store 
information and capture everything in one place"
" 
Up until that point, they had used Excel spreadsheets and paper systems to record data, which 
lead to inaccuracies due to:
• Human error in recording in customer details 
• Individual records being kept within different divisions
For the company this meant a loss of sales due to long turn-around times on quotes or discount requests"
" It also meant that information silos created obstacles to formulating long-term business 
strategies (Sundae Solutions, 2012)"
"
8"
10
"3 The solution
 
By implementing an integrated CRM system, namely the Sage CRM solution, they created a 
centralised repository for information"
" Fuji Xerox also needed a system that would integrate 
well with their existing systems"
" These included an Oracle ERP system at the backend (Sundae 
Solutions, 2012)"
"
The Oracle ERP system is an enterprise resource planning software solution that enables 
businesses to manage all facets of their organisation from development to manufacturing and 
sales"
" The company was also using Microsoft Office on their desktops, which means the system 
needed to integrate with Outlook calendars and email (Sundae Solutions, 2012)"
" 
The system offered contact and customer management functionality as well as sales force 
automation, and placed the focus on the customer and their needs (Sundae Solutions, 2012)"
" 
By implementing a CRM system of this nature, Fuji Xerox essentially enabled the sales team to 
manage their sales pipeline effectively"
" 
Generally, CRM systems allow organisations to choose the exact sales process journey to follow 
by inputting information such as:
• The industry
• How long the sales cycle is
• The qualifying criteria for a sale
• The nature of the sales and how big they are
• How many team members are involved in the process
• What experience they have in their field
• How much managers need to be involvedCRM  ›  The bigger picture CRM  ›  Case study: Fuji Xerox

"4 The results
Through the new system, the sales team was empowered with information"
" This meant:
• More efficient sales management
• Speedier quotations
• Improved approvals processes
 
In the past, sales representatives could only submit quotes or discounts for approval to their managers back at the office, which would take a few days and decrease the likelihood of sales 
conversions"
" The new system meant sales representatives had software that would simulate 
cost, profit and discounts immediately"
 This meant quick preparation of quotes and confidence in knowing that these were accurate and made sound business sense
" 
The new CRM solution also meant quicker response times to sales and support queries, improving 
customer experience (Sundae Solutions, 2012)"
"
After implementing the system, the Fuji Xerox sales teams saw an 8% improvement in customer 
satisfaction ratings"
" There was also clear revenue growth as a result of the initiative (Sundae Solutions, 2012)"

"11 The bigger picture
 
Managing customer relationships should be built into every marketing tactic and activity you perform, especially if your organisation has adopted CRM as an ongoing strategy to drive customer 
retention"
" In the digital space, here are some to watch out for"
" 
Successful email marketing is built on two very basic customer needs: privacy and permission"
" 
The very first step in using email to communicate with a customer is gaining their permission"
" 
Data mining and segmenting customer databases allows email marketing to be tailored and personalised"
 Email is often the primary point of contact for service-related messages
"
Online advertising is a double-edged sword when it comes to CRM"
" It can be a very effective 
acquisition tool for new customers, but intrusive advertising can attract attention for all the wrong 
reasons"
" Effective online advertising speaks to customers’ needs and presents solutions to them, 
attracting attention without being overly intrusive"
 The key is to be relevant and useful wherever possible
"
Affiliate marketing started by making the most of existing relationships other parties have with 
potential customers"
" Affiliate marketing can be an excellent sales and acquisition channel, but is 
not without its problems from a CRM perspective"
" Another entity is acquiring leads on your behalf, 
which can mean a loss of control"
" 
Search engine optimisation and search advertising start with customer intent"
" Existing customer 
data can indicate where to focus search engine marketing efforts, especially when it comes to 
analysing how well a website caters to the intent indicated by a customer’s search term"
""
"226 227CRM  ›  References CRM  ›  The bigger picture
Social media marketing is based on customer needs and preferences"
" It is also a powerful tool 
for turning delighted customers (who are expressive online) into advocates for an organisation"
" 
Social media creates new communication channels for an organisation, enabling discussions and 
customer service to take place where the customer feels most comfortable"
"
Effective web development and design starts with understanding and catering for customer 
needs, and should focus on the experience of the web user"
" Designing for customers first and foremost gives web visitors a seamless experience - CRM data can tell you what your customers 
need, and web experiences can support the customer journey"
" Web designers and developers can 
also create sophisticated customer service portals to manage CRM, such as the Nike+ support page: nikeplus"
nike
com/plus/support
" 
Through all of the digital marketing tactics, effective analytics is the most useful CRM tool"
" It 
allows each channel to be measured on its merits, and the customers acquired by each channel 
can be analysed"

"12 Summary
 
Customer relationship management is the cornerstone of your interactions with customers"
" Digital 
technology makes the process of discovering key insights seamless, effective and very useful, but CRM cannot be restricted to only digital channels as customer interactions happen offline too"
" 
There are many benefits to implementing a CRM strategy – from reduced customer service costs 
to happier customers and more tailored and effective communications"
" 
Naturally, understanding customers is the biggest outcome of CRM – and this understanding 
leads to meeting their needs much more effectively, which in turn has direct bottom-line benefits for the brand"
"
There are many facets to CRM that you should consider before deciding how you will approach it"
" 
The key ones are:
• Brand touchpoints – how do customers interact with the brand, and vice versa?
• The tools you need for your business – operational CRM, analytical CRM, collaborative 
CRM and sales force automation are the main categories"
"
• What channels are available to you to communicate with your clients?
• Implementations – CRM can be implemented for sales, marketing and customer support and service fulfilment"
"
• What are the steps you need to take within your organisation to ensure a successful CRM strategy?
• What cost are you looking at – and what return on investment are you expecting?
• Your long-term aims – CRM is never a short-term solution"
"
• What are your data capabilities and needs – are you gathering the correct data, storing it correctly, updating it constantly and then analysing it for insights? 8"

"1 Introduction
With millions of people performing billions of searches each day to find content on 
the Internet (Sullivan, 2013), it makes sense that marketers want their products 
to be findable online"
" Search engines, the channels through which these searches 
happen, use closely guarded algorithms to determine the results displayed"
 Determining what factors these algorithms take into account has led to a growing practice known as search engine optimisation
"
Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the practice of optimising a website to 
achieve the highest possible ranking on the search engine results pages (SERPs)"
" 
Someone who practices SEO professionally is also known as an SEO (search engine optimiser)"
"
Google says it uses more than 200 different factors in its algorithm to determine 
relevance and ranking (Avellanosa, 2012)"
" None of the major search engines 
disclose the elements they use to rank pages, but there are many SEO practitioners 
who spend time analysing patent applications to try to determine what these are"
"
SEO can be split into two distinct camps: white hat SEO and black hat SEO (with, of 
course, some grey hat wearers in between)"
 Black hat SEO refers to trying to game the search engines
" These SEOs use dubious means to achieve high rankings, and 
their websites are occasionally blacklisted by the search engines"
" White hat SEO, 
on the other hand, refers to working within the parameters set by search engines to optimise a website for better user experience"
" Search engines want to send users to the website that is best suited to their needs, so white hat SEO should 
ensure that users can find what they are looking for"

Term Definition
Alt textThe ‘alt’ attribute for the IMG HTML tag"
" It is used in 
HTML to attribute a text field to an image on a web page, normally with a descriptive function, telling a search engine or user what an image is about and displaying the text in instances where the image is unable to load"
 Also called Alt Tag
"
Anchor text The visible, clickable text in a link"
"
App store optimisation (ASO)The process of optimising mobile and web applications for the specific web stores in which they are distributed"
"
BacklinkAll the links on other pages that will take the user to a specific web page"
 Each link to that specific page is known as an inbound/backlink
" The number of backlinks influences your ranking, so the more backlinks the better – get linking!
CanonicalThe canonical version is the definitive version"
" In SEO, it refers to a definitive URL"

"
FlashA technology used to show video and animation on a website"
 It can be bandwidth heavy and unfriendly to search engine spiders
"
Heading tagsHeading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc"
) are standard elements used to define headings and subheadings on a web page
" The number indicates the importance, so H1 tags are viewed by the spiders as being more important than H3 tags"
 Using target key phrases in your H tags is essential for effective SEO
"
Home pageThe first page of any website"
" The home page gives users a glimpse into what your site is about – very much like the index in a book, or a magazine"
"

"3 Understanding SEO
 
Search engines need to help users find what they’re looking for"
" To make sure they 
list the best results first, they look for signals of:
• Popularity 
• Authority
• Relevance
• Trust
• Importance
SEO, also called organic or natural optimisation, involves optimising websites to achieve high rankings on search engines for certain selected key phrases"
" 
Generally, techniques used for optimising on one search engine will also help 
efforts across others"
"
How search engines work, according to Google:
“PageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page’s value"
" In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page 
B"
" But Google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes, or links, a page 
receives; it also analyzes the page that casts the vote"
 Votes cast by pages that are themselves ‘important’ weigh more heavily and help to make other pages ‘important’
"”
 
SEO can be divided into two main strategies:
1"
" On-page optimisation is achieved by making changes to the HTML 
code, content and structure of a website, making it more accessible for search engines, and by extension, easier for users to find"
" 
2"
" Off-page optimisation is generally focused on building links to the 
website, and covers activities like social media and digital PR"
"
SEO is an extremely effective way of generating new business to a site"
" It is a continuous process and a way of thinking about how search engines see your 
website, and how users use search engines to find your website"
 It’s search psychology

Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)  ›  Understanding SEO Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)  ›  Key terms and concepts
"234 235Search engine optimisation is a fairly technical practice but it can easily be broken 
down into five main areas:
• A search engine friendly website structure
• A well-researched list of key phrases
• Content optimised to target those key phrases
• Link popularity 
• User insights
9"
"4 Search engine friendly website structure
 
Search engines encounter two kinds of obstacles:
• Technical challenges that prevent the search engine spider from accessing content"
"
• A competitive marketing environment where everyone wants to rank highly"
"
To ensure that search engines can access your content, you must remove technical 
barriers"
 Those who want to achieve the best results must follow best practices
" 
These best practices are outlined in the chapter on Web Development and Design"
"
The key is to make sure that there are direct HTML links to each page you want the 
search engines to index"
 The most important pages should be accessible directly from the home page of your website
"
The information architecture, or how content is planned and laid out, has 
important usability and SEO implications"
" Users want to find what they are looking 
for quickly and easily, while website owners want search engine spiders to be able 
to access and index all applicable pages"
" In fact, Google has released an update that penalises sites with poor user experience (such as no content above the fold, 
or a high bounce rate) (Cutts, 2012)"
"
There are times when user experience and SEO can be at odds with each other, but 
usually if you focus on building usable, accessible websites, you have made them 
search engine friendly as well"
"
Another technical challenge to search engines is Flash"
" For the most part, search 
engines struggle to crawl and index Flash sites"
" There are some workarounds, but the best approach from an SEO perspective is to avoid building sites or delivering 
key content in Flash"
" Instead, use HTML5, which provides similar interactivity and 
visuals while remaining easily crawlable"
The chapter on web development and design delves more deeply into building a search engine friendly website
"

"5 SEO and key phrases
 
How do you start building your key phrase list? It requires a little thought and a fair amount of research and insight, using tools that are readily available to help you 
grow and refine your list of keywords"
"
Key phrases are the very foundation of search"
" When a user enters a query on 
a search engine, he or she uses the words he or she thinks are relevant to the 
search"
" The search engine then returns those pages it believes are most relevant to the words the searcher used – and, increasingly, the implied meaning of the 
search"
"
Search engines have built a sophisticated understanding of semantics and the way 
in which we use language"
" So, if a user searches for ‘car rental’, the search engine 
will look for pages that are relevant to ‘car rental’ as well as, possibly, ‘car hire’, ‘vehicle hire’, and so forth"
" Search engines have also built up knowledge around common misspellings, synonyms and related searches"
"
Figure 1"
 Google delivers search results for logical synonyms
"
Because of this, it is crucial that you implement keywords that are likely to be used 
by their target audience"
" Websites need to appear when their potential customers 
are searching for them"
" A large part of keyword research is understanding search 
psychology"
" When we build our key phrase lists, we are tapping into the mental process of searchers and putting together the right mix of keywords to target"
"NOTE
Keyword or key phrase? 
These are usually used interchangeably to refer to single or multiple words used for optimising websites"

"236 237There are four things to consider when choosing a keyword:
Search volume
How many searchers are using that phrase to find what they want? For example, 
there is an estimated monthly search volume of over 338 million for the keyword 
‘hotel’, but an estimated 6 600 searches per month for a key phrase such as ‘Cape 
Town Waterfront hotel’"
" 
Figure 2"
" The AdWords Keyword Planner shows the volume of global and local 
monthly searches"
"
Competition
How many other websites out there are targeting that same phrase? For example, 
Google finds over 2 800 000 000 results for ‘hotel’, but only 3 210 000 for ‘Cape 
Town Waterfront Hotel’"
"
Propensity to convert
What is the likelihood that the searcher using that key phrase is going to convert 
on your site? A conversion is a desired action taken by the visitor to your website"
" 
Related to propensity to convert is the relevance of the selected term to what you 
are offering"
" If you are selling rooms at a hotel at the V&A Waterfront, which of 
the two terms (‘hotel’ or ‘Cape Town Waterfront hotel’) do you think will lead to a 
higher rate of conversions?
Value per lead
What is the average value per prospect attracted by the keyword? Depending on the nature of your website, the average value per lead varies"
" Using the hotel example again, consider these two terms: 
‘luxury Cape Town hotel’ and ‘budget Cape Town hotel’ Both are terms used by someone wanting to book a hotel in Cape Town, but it is 
likely that someone looking for a luxury hotel is intending to spend more"
" That 
means that that particular lead has a higher value, particularly if you have a hotel-booking website that offers a range of accommodation"

"1 Step-by-step key phrase research
Step 1: Brainstorm
Think about the words you would use to describe your business, and about the questions or needs of your customers that it fulfils"
" How would someone ask for 
what you are offering? Consider synonyms and misspellings as well"
"
Bear in mind that people may not ask for your services in the same way as you 
describe them"
" You may sell ‘herbal infusions’, whereas most people would ask for 
‘herbal teas’, and some might even request a ‘tisane’"
" 
Even common words are often misspelt, and you may need to consider common 
misspellings – for example, ‘jewelry’ or ‘morgage’"
"
Figure 3"
 Google returns relevant results even for common misspellings
"
Step 2: Gather data
Two ways in which to gather accurate key phrase data are to survey customers and 
to look at your website referral logs"
"
Look to see what terms customers are already using to find you, and add those to 
your list"
" If they are already sending you some traffic, it is worth seeing if you can 
increase that traffic"
"NOTE
If you’re researching 
keywords using the 
Google AdWords 
Keyword Planner, note 
that it reports only on 
paid search volume, not 
on total volume"
"
NOTE
Misspellings are 
important, but consider what these tell you about the traffic you are getting – analyse this traffic to ensure that you’re getting quality visitors"

"238 239Step 3: Use keyword research tools
There are several tools available for keyword discovery, and some of them are free"
" 
Some tools will scan your website and suggest keywords based on your current 
content"
" Most will let you enter keywords, and will then return suggestions based 
on past research data, along with:
• Similar keywords
• Common keywords used with that keyword
• Common misspellings
• Frequency of the keywords in search queries
• Industry-related keywords
• Keywords that are sending traffic to your competitors
• How many sites are targeting your keywords
See Tools of the Trade for some tools that you can use"
"
Bearing in mind the factors that make a good keyword, you need to aim for the right 
mix of keywords"
" Low-volume terms with low levels of competition may be a good way to get traffic in the short term, but don’t be scared off by bigger competition 
in the high-value, high-volume areas"
" It may take longer to get there, but once you 
do, the revenue can make it all worthwhile"
"
It is a good idea to create a spreadsheet of the list of keywords, along with additional 
information about each one"

"2 Optimising content for key phrases
Once keywords and phrases are selected, we need to ensure the site contains content to target them"
" You must ensure that the content is properly structured 
and that it sends signals of relevance"
" Content is the most important part of your 
website: create relevant, targeted content aimed at your selected key phrases"
"
As you know from the content strategy chapter, content already has several roles 
to play on your site:
• It must provide information to visitors"
"
• It must engage with them"
"
• It must persuade them to do what you want"
" 
Now it must also send signals of relevance to search engines"
" You need to use the keywords on the content page in a way that search engines will pick up, and users will understand"
" 
Each web page should be optimised for two to three key phrases: the primary key 
phrase, the secondary and the tertiary"
" A page can be optimised for up to five key 
phrases, but it is better to have more niche pages than fewer unfocused pages"
"
Here are some guidelines:
1"
" Title tag: use the key phrase in the title and as close to the beginning as 
possible"
"
2"
" H1 header tag: use the key phrase in the header tag, and as much as possible in the other H tags"
"
3"
" Body content: use the key phrase at least three times, more if there is a lot of content and it makes sense to"
" You should aim for about 350 
words of content"
" But don’t overdo it! That could look like spam to the 
search engines"
"
4"
 Bold: use <strong> tags around the keyword at least once
"
5"
 URL: try to use the key phrase in your page URL
"
6"
" Meta description: use it at least once in the meta description of the page, which should entice users to clickthrough to your site from the SERP"
"
7"
" Link anchor text: try to ensure that the keyword is used in the anchor 
text of the pages linking to you"
" 
8"
" Domain name: if possible, use the key phrase in your domain name"
"NOTE
Try it now: Pick one of 
the tools listed at the 
end of the chapter and 
try a little of your own 
keyword research"

""
"240 241Optimising media
Images, video and other digital assets should also be optimised with the relevant 
keywords"
" Search engines cannot decipher multimedia content as well as text, so 
they rely on the way that media is described to determine what it is about"
" Screen 
readers also read out these descriptions, which can help visually impaired users make sense of a website"
" In addition, media such as images and video are often also shown on the SERPs"
" Proper optimisation can give a brand more ownership of 
the SERP real estate, and can also be used effectively to target competitive terms"
" 
Just as rich media can help emphasise the content on a page to a visitor, they can 
also help search engines to rank pages, provided they are labelled correctly"
"
Here are some ways to optimise images with key phrases for SEO:
• Use descriptive, keyword-filled filenames"
"
• Use specific alt tags and title attributes"
"
• Add meta information to the image"
" Make sure this information is 
relevant"
"
• Use descriptive captions, and keep relevant copy close to the 
corresponding media"
" For example, an image caption and neighbouring 
text will help to describe content of the image"
"
• Make sure that the header tags and images are relevant to each other"
"
Also think about what other digital assets you have, and whether these can be optimised in line with your key phrase strategy"
" For example, consider app store optimisation (ASO) – the process of optimising your mobile and web apps for the 
specific web stores they are distributed in"
"
Here are some ways in which you can optimise your apps:
• Give your app a catchy name that also includes your most important 
keyword or phrase"
"
• Include a distinctive, recognisable and clear icon"
"
• Spell out the features and benefits clearly, including key phrases where possible"
"
• In your app store listing, add links to your major social media platforms 
and your website – and don’t forget to link the other way too!
• Include as much meta data as you can, including tags, categories and 
descriptions (this will depend on the app store in question) (Bulygin, 2013)"
 Figure 5
 An example of a page targeting the phrase ‘handmade bags’
"
The best way to ensure results is to focus on writing quality content while sticking 
to a few guidelines on tags and URLs"
" Remember, you want search engines to 
rank you highly for your content, but you also want to ensure that the content is a 
pleasure to read"
"
Regularly adding fresh, valuable content will also encourage the search engines to 
crawl your site more frequently"
"
Use your website and its pages to establish and reinforce themes"
" Information can 
always be arranged in some kind of hierarchical structure"
" Just as a single page can have a heading and then get broken down into sub-headings, a large website 
can have main themes that get broken down into sub-themes"
" Search engines will 
see these themes and recognise your website as one with rich content"
"

"6 Link popularity
 
Links are a vital part of how the Internet works"
" The purpose of a link is to allow a 
user to go from one web page to another"
" Search engines, doing their best to mimic 
the behaviour of humans, also follow links"

NOTE
As search engines 
become ever more sophisticated and user focused, creating entertaining and readable copy will be much more important than simply including keywords in your text"
 
"242 243Besides allowing search engine spiders to find websites, links are a way of 
validating relevance and indicating importance"
" When one page links to another, 
it is as if that page is voting or vouching for the destination page"
" Generally, the 
more votes a website receives, the more trusted it becomes, the more important it is deemed, and the better it will rank on search engines"
"
Links help send signals of trust"
" Signals of trust can come only from a third-party 
source"
" Few people will trust someone who says, “Don’t worry, you can trust me!” 
unless someone else, who is already trusted, says, “Don’t worry, I know him well"
" 
You can trust him"
” It is the same with links and search engines
 Trusted sites can transfer trust to unknown sites via links
"
Links help to validate relevance"
" Text links, by their very nature, contain text 
(thank you, Captain Obvious)"
" The text that makes up the link can help validate 
relevance"
" A link such as ‘Cape Town hotel’ sends the message that, “You can 
trust that the destination site is relevant to the term ‘Cape Town hotel’"
"” If the destination web page has already used content to send a signal of relevance, the link simply validates that signal"

"1 The parts of a link
 
Here is the HTML code for a link:
<a href=“http://www"
targeturl
com/targetpage
"htm”>Anchor Text</a>
• <a href> and </a> are HTML tags that show where the link starts and 
ends"
"
• http://www"
targeturl
com/targetpage
htm is the page that the link leads to
" You should make sure that you are linking to a relevant page in your 
site, and not just to the home page"
"
• Anchor Text is the visible text that forms the link"
 This is the text that should contain the key phrase you are targeting
"
 
The link sends a signal that the target URL is important for the subject used in the anchor text"
"
There is a lot more information that can be included in this anatomy, such as 
instructions telling the search engine not to follow the link, or instructions to the 
browser on whether the link should open in a new window or not"
<a href=“http://www
targeturl
com/targetpage
"htm” rel=“nofollow”>Anchor Text</a>
• rel=“nofollow” can be included in links when you don’t want to vouch for 
the target URL"

" This was introduced by Google to try to combat comment 
spam"

"2 Not all links are created equal
 
Of course, not all links are equal"
" While link volume is the number of links coming 
to a specific page of your site, link authority looks at the value of the links"
" Some 
sites are more trusted than others"
" So, if they are more trusted, then links from 
those sites are worth more"
" Likewise, some sites are more relevant than others to specific terms"
" The more relevant a site, the more value is transferred by the link"
" Well-known and established news sites, government sites ("
"gov) and university 
domains ("
ac) are examples of sites from which links can carry more weighting
" 
Links form websites that have a higher PageRank also carry more link weight"
"
Figure 6"
 Links from universities and government bodies carry more weight
"
Search algorithms also consider relationships between linked sites"
" By analysing 
various things, the search engines try to determine if the links are natural links, or if they are manipulative, artificial links created solely for ranking purposes"
" 
Manipulated links are worth very little compared to natural links and may even 
lead to a drop in search engine rankings"
"
The search engine algorithm will also determine the relevancy of the referring 
website to the site being linked to"
" The more relevant the sites are to each other, the better"
"
Also consider that linking to valuable, relevant external resources can help to 
improve the visibility of your own site"

"3 How does a website get more links?
 
With links playing such a vital role in search engine rankings and traffic for a 
website, everyone wants more of them"

to generate links for a website"
" Quirk has released a Mozilla Firefox extension 
called SearchStatus that is exceptionally useful to the SEO community"

"7 User insights 
 
Search engines want their results to be highly relevant to web users, to make 
sure that web users keep returning to the search engine for future searches"
" And 
the best way to establish what is relevant to users? By looking at how they use 
websites, of course!
User data is the most effective way of judging the true relevance and value of a 
website"
" For example, if users arrive on a website and leave immediately, chances are it wasn’t relevant to their query in the first place"
" However, if a user repeatedly 
visits a website and spends a long time there, it is probably extremely relevant"
" 
When it comes to search engines, relevant, valuable sites are promoted, and irrelevant sites are demoted"
" 
How do search engines access this data?
Search engines use cookies to maintain a history of a user’s search activity"
" This will include keywords used, and websites visited from the search engine"
" Search 
engines gather data on the clickthrough rate of results, and on bounce rates"
"
Site speed, that is, the performance of your website, is a contributing factor to 
ranking in Google"
" Google confirmed in April 2010 at this was one of over 200 
ranking signals (Singhal, 2010)"
"So, what does this mean for SEO? When it comes to a website, it must:
• Be valuable enough to attract both visitors and links naturally 
• Retain visitors and make sure they return to the website
• Convert visitors

"1 Social and search
 
Social information is playing an ever-increasing role in search"
" Social content, 
such as Twitter messages or YouTube videos, can appear in the SERPs, and there 
is a growing indication of social influence on search rankings"
" 
There are several social factors to consider when it comes to social and search"
"
Figure 10"
 A Google search for Coca-Cola turns up several social media profiles
"
1"
 Use social media properties to dominate brand SERPs
"
When someone searches for your brand name, you can use your social media 
properties to ‘own’ more of the results on that page, reducing the likelihood 
that a user will end up on a competitor’s website instead"
" Use your brand 
name when naming Twitter and Flickr profiles, and Facebook and YouTube pages"
" 
2"
 Social links are used as signals of relevance
"
Links from social sites such as Twitter include “rel=nofollow”"
" However, there is a strong indication that these links are in fact followed by search engines, 
and are used to determine relevance"
" If you focus on creating great content 
on your site and making sure that it is easy to share socially, you should see a result in your SEO efforts"
"
3"
 Personalised results are influenced by your online social network
"
If you are logged in to a social network while searching (Facebook for Bing, or your Gmail account for Google), you could see results from or influenced by 
your social circle"
" In Bing, for instance, results can include indications of what 
your friends have previously liked or shared via Facebook"
" On Google, you may be more likely to see your friend’s blog for relevant searches"

"2 Mobile search
 
As web-enabled mobile devices continue to grow in the market, and become easier to use, mobile search remains a key growth area"
" Mobile searches tend to 
be different from desktop searches"
" They are more navigational in nature (users 
tend to know where they want to end up), and users are often looking for concise, actionable answers"
"
Mobile search input can also be different from desktop search"
" As well as typing 
in search keywords, mobile users can search by voice, or by using images or 
scanning barcodes"
" 
As with mobile web development, mobile SEO is a little different from desktop 
SEO, although the fundamental principles remain the same"
" Build usable and 
accessible sites with great content, and you’ve already come a long way"
"Where there are differences in approach for mobile SEO, these are largely because:
• Search engines have the ability to deliver precise location-based results to mobile users"
"
• Usability is critical in sites for mobile devices"
"
• Search engines have less data to work with (compared to traditional web) in terms of site history, traffic, and inbound links"
"
 
The fundamentals of mobile SEO are not so different to those of desktop SEO"
"
1"
" A usable, crawlable site is very important"
"
Build mobile versions of your website that cater for mobile users: simple navigation and content stripped down to only what is required"
"
2"
" Content is important, and should be formatted for mobile usage"
"
Text and images should be optimised for the mobile experience – so no large file sizes! The meta data still matters: titles and descriptions are what users 
see in the SERPs"
"
3"
 Links are important
"
You should link to your mobile site from your desktop site and vice versa"
 Submit your mobile site to relevant mobile directories
"
4"
 Submit a mobile XML sitemap
"
Mobile-specific sitemaps use the same protocols as standard XML sitemaps, with the addition of a mobile tag"
"
5"
" Use the word ‘mobile’ on the mobile website, or use mobile 
top-level domains"
"
Make it explicit to search engines that this is the mobile version of your 
website, and they are more likely to prioritise it as such"
"
9"

"3 Local search
 
Local search refers to search behaviour and results where location matters"
" Either results returned are local in nature, or results returned can be map based"
"
With blended SERPs, map-based results can be returned together with other types 
of results, depending on the type of search"
" As search engines become ever more 
sophisticated, location can be inferred and influence the type of results"

Figure 12"
" A Google search for ‘pizza in Florence’ turns up a range of location-based 
results, displayed on a map"
"
For example, a user may search for ‘plumber london’, and the search will know

 These may even be returned on a map
" 
However, a user in London may search just for ‘plumber’"
" The search can infer 
from the user’s IP address that the user is in London, and still return results for London plumbers (since someone searching for this term is likely to be looking for 
a nearby service)"
"
For search engines to return location-relevant results, they need to know the 
location of things being searched for"
" This is often determined from sites that 
include the name and address of a business"
 Note that this site may not be yours
" Location results are often determined from various review sites, and the results 
can include some of those reviews"
"
Search engines also allow businesses to ‘claim’ their locations"
" A business can 
verify itself through a process with the search engine, and ensure that location 
information is correct"
" Google+ Local is a good example of this – the business can claim a listing, add their details, and even receive reviews"

• Don’t send automated queries to Google"
"
• Don’t load pages with irrelevant keywords"

"10 Benefits and challenges
 
Optimising a website for search engines should entail optimising the website for users"
" Done properly, it should result in a better user experience, while ensuring 
that search engines index and rank the website well"
"
However, it can be tempting to focus on the technicalities of SEO while forgetting 
that both robots and humans need to read the same website"
" One should not be 
sacrificed for the other"
"
Search engines update their algorithms regularly"
" Each update is an attempt 
to improve search results, but can result in loss of rankings for some websites, depending on the update"
" A contingency plan, such as a prepared search advertising campaign, needs to be in place to cope with a sudden drop in rankings"
"
As with any digital marketing practice, SEO should not be the only focus of digital 
marketing efforts"
 It works best when part of a holistic online marketing strategy

"2 The problem
 
Viewpoints"
com is an online portal for consumer reviews and product rankings
" Launched in 2007, the website became very popular and, by 2011, was doubling its traffic year on year and had 
attracted over 2"
7 million unique users
" The site housed over 600 000 original product reviews that 
had been personally written by its 250 000 members, and the site was always run with good SEO practices taken into account"
" 
In 2011, Google announced that it would be launching a new algorithm update called Panda – the 
aim was to penalise websites that were merely content and link farms and that did not provide 
any value to searchers"
" As mentioned in the notes, search engines are constantly tweaking their 
algorithms to stay a step ahead of SEO spammers and exploits, and the Panda update was another attempt to ensure Google was serving the most relevant and useful results"
"
Despite their good SEO practices, Viewpoints"
"com unexpectedly lost around 50% of their organic 
search traffic from one day to the next – because of the new rules of the Panda update"
" The 
company was then faced with the following challenges"
" They had to:
1"
" Understand what it was about their site that was harming rankings
2"
" Develop short- and long-term strategies to tackle these issues
3"
" Revamp the website user experience in line with the algorithm update

"3 The solution
 
Viewpoints"
"com realised that it would take more than just a few little tweaks to fix their rankings 
– this would require a radical rethink of their entire approach to the website"
" They took on a multi-
pronged approach and made some massive changes"
"
• In three months, they implemented quick fixes such as removing 40% of the ads on the site, improving the site speed threefold, and deleting over 80 000 low-quality reviews"
"
• To combat apparently thin content pages, they amalgamated short reviews onto single 
pages, eliminating over 600 000 unique pages from the site"
 Users were also given a minimum review length to cut down on one-line reviews

"12 The bigger picture
 
Search engine optimisation can be influenced and enhanced by most other digital marketing campaigns, and they should all be approached with this in mind"
" 
SEO and content marketing go hand in hand, since SEO relies on fresh, relevant and popular 
content, and content marketing can be informed by SEO key phrases and insights"
"For example, search advertising campaigns can provide valuable keyword research, which can 
then be fed into the SEO strategy"
" Social media marketing can generate an enormous amount of 
links to a website"
" Digital PR aims to generate links too, and these can be optimised for search engines"
" 
User research and web analytics can generate insights into how users find the website, which 
can inform SEO strategy – and effective SEO techniques can provide insights into user behaviour"

"13 Summary
 
The average website receives a significant proportion of its traffic from search engines, highlighting the importance of SEO"
"
There are two types of search results:
• Organic or natural results
• Paid results
SEO aims to improve a website’s ranking in the organic results"
" Search engine optimisation is a 
fairly technical practice but it can easily be broken down into five main areas:
1"
" A search engine friendly website structure
2"
" A well-researched list of key phrases
3"
" Content optimised to target those key phrases

"1 Introduction
Search advertising, also called pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, is a way to 
advertise your business or product directly on search engine results pages, where 
the advertiser pays only for each click on their advert"
" 
Search advertising continues to evolve, and formats available range from simple 
text adverts through to rich media banners and even video adverts"
" PPC advertising 
revolutionised the online advertising industry, and today, search advertising generates 95% of Google’s revenue (Peterson, 2013)"
" 
Adverts on search engines are easy to spot – they’re clearly labelled as advertising 
and are separated from organic search results"
" They can appear on the top of the 
results page, usually in a box, and also on the right hand side of the results page"
"
Figure 1"
 Search adverts appearing in a search for digital marketing
"
Search advertising on search engines is keyword based – this means that it is 
triggered by the search term that a user enters into a search engine"
" Advertisers 
target the keywords for which they want to appear"
"
For the advertiser, the beauty of search advertising is that adverts are displayed 
when potential customers are already expressing intent – they are searching for 
a product or service"
 It allows advertisers to present their offering to a potential customer who is already in the buying cycle
"Google is, by a wide margin, the leader in the search advertising field; because of this, the chapter is very Google-centric, though the same principle should apply to any other search advertising platforms"
" Other platforms to be aware of are Bing, Yahoo and Baidu"
"
In this chapter, you will learn:
• How to put together a search advert
• How to target your search ad at relevant users
• The process of bidding on key phrases and how this affects your ranking
• How to plan, set up and run your own search advertising campaign

"2 Key terms and concepts
 
Term Definition
Clickthrough A click on a text ad link that leads to a website"
"
Clickthrough rate (CTR)The total clicks on a link divided by the number of times 
that ad link has been shown, expressed as a percentage"
"
Conversion rateThe number of conversions divided by the number of visitors, expressed as a percentage"
" 
Cost per action (CPA)The amount paid when a certain action is performed by a user"
"
Cost per click (CPC) The amount paid when a link is clicked on"
"
Google AdWordsGoogle’s search advertising program, which allows advertisers to display their adverts on relevant search results and across Google’s content network"
"
Impression Each time an advert is shown"
"
Key phraseTwo or more words that are combined to form a search query - often referred to as keywords"
"
KeywordA word found in a search query"
" For example, a search for ‘blue widgets’ includes the keywords ‘blue’ and ‘widgets’"
"
Organic resultsAlso known as natural results"
 Search results served by the search engine’s algorithm
 The search engine does not charge website owners to list these results
"
Paid search advertisingUsually refers to advertising on search engines, sometimes called PPC advertising"
 The advertiser pays only for each click on the advert

Search Advertising  ›  Key terms and concepts Search Advertising  ›  Introduction"
"266 267Quality score (QS)A measure used by Google AdWords to indicate how 
relevant a keyword is to an ad text and to a user’s search query"
"

"

10"
"3 Advertising in search
 
Search engines display results to search queries based on proprietary algorithms"
" 
Each major search engine uses its own formula to determine what results to 
display for any term"
" According to PEW Internet, 73% of all Americans use search 
engines, and 59% of them use search engines daily; on top of that, 91% of people who use search engines say that they find the information they are looking for most or all of the time (Purcell, et al"
", 2012)"
" With search engines getting so much traffic, 
and delivering so much value, they need to find a way of generating revenue"
"
With so many search engines out there, which platform should you choose?
There are some small differences from platform to platform in terms of editorial 
policy, and each system has a different user interface"
" There is some theory that 
different platforms are better for different industries, for example, that Yahoo fares better than Google on travel advertising"
" However, this is subjective, and most 
large advertisers will run PPC campaigns on a number of platforms"
" As with most 
things in digital marketing, it is all about testing"
"
Google AdWords is the best known and is considered the industry standard; it 
allows users to transact in the currency of their choice, is tied to a comprehensive analytics tool, and offers training programmes and certifications"
" Google AdWords 
also currently has the best contextual and geographical targeting worldwide, 
although geo-targeting is also offered by Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads and YouTube video ads (which is closely linked to AdWords)"

"1 Structuring your search advertising campaign
 
When you start running search advertising, you shouldn’t just create a whole stream of ads – you need to have a plan"
" 
Your AdWords account is your home for all the ads you are currently running, and it 
should be structured to reflect your business and marketing strategy"
" Within your 
account, organise your search adverts in groupings – called campaigns – according 
to your strategy and the ads you are running"
" Within each campaign, you should have ad groups – these are sets of ads that have a common characteristic or focus"
" For example, if you are selling books online, you may have ad groups focused 
around a specific genre, author, event and special offer, as well as some ad groups 
around general themes such as promoting local stores, or making online sales"
"
Figure 2"
 The main constituents of an AdWords campaign
" (Source: Google, 2008)
Structuring your account in this way will help you to easily oversee your advertising 
spend, determine the effectiveness of your ads, manage your ads and bids, and 
switch off any ads that aren’t working effectively"

"4 The elements of a search ad 
Basic search adverts all follow a similar format:
Heading
Two lines of advert copy"
" 
Sometimes shown on one line"
"
www"
DisplayURL
"comAd extension
As you can see, these consist of several elements – the key is to make these work 
together harmoniously in order to get searchers to click through to your website"
" 
The three main components are:
• Keyword-optimised ad text 
• The link to your owned property (website, social media platform, 
content)
• Ad extensions
10"
4
"1 Ad text
 
The ad text is the main component of a search ad"
 Search engines limit the characters in each line
" There are also restrictions on what you are allowed to 
write in an advert"
" Here are some of the editorial guidelines from Google AdWords:
• Heading: maximum of 25 characters
• Line 1: maximum of 35 characters
• Line 2: maximum of 35 characters
• Display URL: maximum of 35 characters
• No repeated exclamation marks"
"
• No word may be written in capitals only"
"
• No nonsense words may be used"
"• No claims of ‘best’, ‘number one’ or superlatives may be used unless 
they can be verified by a reliable third-party source"
"
• Product numbers may be used"
"
• No phone numbers allowed in the copy"
"
Writing effective copy
For most PPC adverts, the advert copy is the only tool available to attract attention, convey a message and entice action"
" This is why writing effective advert copy is 
such an important skill for search advertising"
"
People who are searching for something usually have a specific intent – they 
are looking for information, guidance, comparisons, tools, or solutions to their 
problems"
" It’s important to understand why somebody would look for your brand or product – and what keywords they would use to find it – when crafting your 
search ads"
" Look at the considerations for choosing keywords that are covered in 
the Search Engine Optimisation chapter – these often overlap"
" 
Use compelling and well-crafted Calls to Action so that users know what to do and 
what to expect: ‘try now’, ‘sign up now’, ‘buy now’"
"
Many advertisers test offers in the advert copy, such as a discount or limited-
time voucher"
" Product or service benefits make for good advert copy, such as free 
shipping, secure shopping or fast delivery"
"
If you are running many ads at once, it can be quite a lot of work to create unique 
copy for each one"
" Dynamic keyword insertion (inserting the search keyword dynamically into the advert copy that appears) or using the keyword in the advert 
copy can help"
" Dynamic keyword insertion takes the keyword in your campaign that 
matches with the user search query and inserts it into the ad automatically"
" This way, the ad looks more relevant to the user than a generic ad"
" The search engine 
will mark words that match the search term in bold, making the advert stand out 
a little bit more"
"
The downside of using dynamic keyword insertion is that you have less control 
over when an ad is shown to a user, and the results may not be as good as with a standard SEM campaign"
" The goal is to generate as many clicks as possible, but 
sometimes the advertiser is better off with fewer, high-quality clicks that generate 
actual sales"

"270 271The long tail
Moz, a respected SEO blog, asserts that 70% of searches on the web are unique 
(Moz, 2012)"
" This means that the sum of searches that are unique is higher than 
the sum of non-unique searches"
" Looking a little more closely at search terms will 
show a small number of high-volume searches, and then a large number of lower volume searches stretching out to those unique searches"
"
Figure 3"
 An example of long tail keywords
"
This is sometimes referred to as the long tail of search"
" Discovering these low-
volume, niche search terms can do wonders for a search advertising campaign"
" 
Generally there is not much competition for these search terms, and the search term itself is very much targeted, so it will likely be cheaper to bid on and may yield 
a high conversion rate"
" While long-tail phrases are generally cheaper and lead to a 
higher rate of conversions, you will need to use a much larger number of them to make up for the lower traffic volume that they generate"
"
Also consider that search engine users may be at various stages of the buying 
cycle, and it could be worthwhile to craft a long-tail keyword strategy targeting 
those who are at the end of the buying cycle and know specifically what they are 
looking for"
" For example, if you sell cameras, targeting the term ‘camera’ may not bring in 
much targeted traffic (since someone searching for ‘camera’ may be looking 
for information, pictures, price comparisons, or even something completely unrelated)"
" But someone looking for ‘buy Canon DSLR camera in London’ has a 
clear intention in mind and could be a great target for advertising"
"

"2 Display URL 
 
Search ads allow you to include a display URL"
" The URL shown is not necessarily 
the URL that the user will click through to – the display URL (what is shown on the 
advert) actually directs to the destination URL (what the actual URL of the page is)"
" 
The display URL is sometimes also called a vanity URL"
" 
Figure 4"
 A Google search advert with a clear display URL
"
 
The display URL must be the same domain as the destination URL"
" Google will 
show only one advert per domain"
"
The page that the user is taken to is called the landing page, which can be any page 
on your website, not necessarily the home page"
" The aim should be to send users 
to a web page that is as specific to their search, and the PPC advert, as possible"
" 
This is known as deep-linking"
"
Landing pages
Search advertising is not just about creating adverts and bidding for keywords"
 The process continues once a user has clicked on your advert
" The page that the user 
reaches by clicking on an advert is called a landing page – either an existing page 
on your website, or a new custom-built page for the campaign at hand (useful if you are running a competition or special offer)"

Figure 5"
 The Social Safe landing and home page
"
Landing pages can make or break an advertising campaign"
" Poorly executed PPC 
campaigns will send all users to the home page of a website"
" Campaigns that convert will make sure that users land on a page that is relevant to their search 
with a very visible Call to Action"
" The aim is to keep the user as focused on the goal 
– conversion – as possible"
 Sending users to the home page gives them too many other options to choose from
"
For example, if someone searched for ‘Canon EOS 450D’, a poorly run campaign 
would send that user to www"
canon
co
uk
 A better campaign would have the user clicking through to www
canon
co
uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_450D/index
asp
"
Landing pages also indicate relevance to the search engine, which can increase 
the Quality Score of the advert, and in turn lower the cost per click (CPC) of the 
keyword"
 Adding keyword-rich pages to the website can also have SEO benefits
"
PPC campaigns often have thousands of keywords, which can mean that you will 
have a lot of landing pages to build"
" Creating dynamic landing pages means that with a simple script, unique keyword-rich landing pages can be created for every search"
" The script will take the keyword that the searcher has used, and insert it 
in predefined places on the landing page"
" The user will then be landing on a page 
that is highly relevant to their search"

"3 Ad Extensions
 
Google offers several ways to add value or information to search adverts"

Search adverts are targeted in a variety of ways, depending on how you want to 
reach your intended audience"
" Targeting your adverts means you know that the 
traffic you are getting is relevant to your product"

"1 Keywords and match types
 
It’s not enough simply to pick the right keywords; you need to know about the 
different ways in which the search engine interprets and matches the search term 
to your chosen keyword"
"
Most search engines require the advertiser to enter the search keywords for which 
their advert should appear"
" 
Considering the massive volume of searches conducted every day, it would be 
impossible to determine all the possible terms potential customers might use to find you"
 That is why there are different keyword match types for search advertising
"
Google AdWords using the following match types:
• Broad match
• Broad match modifier
• Phrase match
• Exact match
• Negative match
Broad match means that your advert will appear for the keywords you have 
entered, as well as search terms that contain your keywords and any other words 
in any order, as well as some variations of your keywords (such as misspellings 
and synonyms)"
"
The broad match modifier is an additional targeting option that gives you tighter 
control than broad match (by excluding synonyms but including other versions of 
the word, such as plurals"
 It’s implemented with a + before the keyword
"
Phrase match, which is denoted with quotation marks around the keywords 
(‘phrase match’) means that your advert will appear only for search terms that 
have your keywords in them, in the same order, though other words may also be 
in the search term"
"Exact match, denoted by square brackets ([exact match]), means that the advert will appear for search terms only exactly the same as the keywords selected"
"
Negative match, denoted by using a dash in front of the keywords (–negative), 
means that your advert will not appear in searches using that word, no matter 
what other words are used"
"

 How search engines interpret and match search terms
" (Source: Google)
Advertisers can assign as many keywords as they want to an advert, but only one 
advert for each URL will be shown"
" If two advertisers are bidding to show adverts for the same domain, only one will be shown"
" Which advert will be shown is based 
on the bids being placed and on the quality of the adverts – more on that later"
"
10"
5
"2 Language and location targeting
 
Search engines have versions customised for specific regions and languages, 
based on the user’s settings and where in the world they are searching from"
" As 
a search marketer, you can choose the language and the location of the search 
engine to target"
 This is known as geo-targeting
" 
For example, you may want your advert to show only to English searches in Asia, 
or to French searches in Johannesburg"
" Targeting your advert means that your ads won’t be seen by people outside your target area, and you won’t pay for traffic that 
you cannot convert into customers"
"

"3 Behavioural and demographic targeting
 
Search advertising can also be targeted based on personal behaviour"

"278 279Using AdWords, you can re-target visitors who came to your site via an AdWords 
advert based on actions that they took"
" This means that if someone came to 
your site, but did not complete a purchase, you can target adverts to them in the 
SERPs (or through other online advertising channels, such as the Google Display Network)"
" This is called re-marketing or re-targeting, and can be very effective for remaining top of mind until the user is ready to convert"
" It is usually advisable 
to cap the number of times a re-marketing ad is shown to an individual to avoid 
annoying them"
"
10"
"6 Bidding and ranking for search ads
 
As you know, search adverts are charged on a per-click basis"
" The cost that you pay for every click is determined by a variety of factors, and is based on a bidding 
system"
"
The different advertising platforms offer advanced bidding options, all aimed at 
helping you to run your advertising campaign better"
" You can bid for placement on 
the SERP, or you can bid based on how much you are willing to pay per click"
" You are also able to tailor your approach to, for example, bidding for adverts during certain times of the day only"
"
Search advertising is usually run as a Vickrey auction model, so advertisers place 
bids to appear based on certain criteria"
" The advertising platform determines when 
adverts are eligible to appear and serves them as appropriate"
" The advertiser then 
pays the advertising platform when their advert is clicked on"
"

With search advertising, the advertiser:
• Creates the copy for an advertisement"
"
• Determines the landing page for the advert"
• Selects the keywords or criteria for which that advertisement should appear
"
• Chooses the maximum amount – the cost per click (CPC) – that they are willing to pay for a click on the advert"
"
The advertising platform:
• Checks the advert for compliance with editorial guidelines"
"
• Displays the advert for relevant search queries or other criteria"
"
• Determines the rank of the advert based on the advertiser’s maximum 
bid and the relevance of the advert (which includes factors such as 
clickthrough rate, ad copy, keyword and landing page relevance)"
"
• In Google AdWords, as well as deciding on your CPC bids for your keywords, you are able to set budgets for your campaign"
" You can set daily budgets, monthly budgets, or no budget"
" Once your total is 
reached, your adverts no longer run, so you can be sure that you never 
overspend"
" If you are concerned about overspending, you can set a daily budget"
" However, this can mean that your adverts do not run as often as you would like them to"

"1 Conversion and clickthrough rates
 
Search engines look at factors such as relevancy to try to ensure that it is not just advertisers with deep pockets that can land the top ad listing"
" Search engines need 
to ensure that users find the adverts relevant, otherwise they’ll be less likely to 
click on them – and no click means no revenue for the search engine"
" 
Studies repeatedly show that those adverts nearer the top of the page attract the 
highest clickthrough rates (CTRs) (Soames, 2013)"
 Competition for these top spots can be fierce and the cost per click can be very high
"
Ads at the top of a page generally have the following qualities:
• They are very relevant to a user’s search query"
"
• The consistently perform well, with high CTRs over time"
"
• The CPC bid is competitive and outbids other ads of the same quality"

 An image illustrating clickthrough and conversion rates
"
You may think that more clicks are better, but is this necessarily the case? Being 
in the top position means that you may pay more per click"
" When your advertising budget is limited, it is often more cost effective not to bid too much for your 
keywords and to occupy the lower ad positions"
" Because you’ll pay less per click, 
you can achieve more clicks (and potential customers) for your limited search advertising budget"
"
Advertisers need to consider what a user does after clicking through to the 
advertiser’s website from the search engine"
" When planning a search advertising 
campaign, it is therefore crucial to set the goals of the campaign upfront, and 
make sure that these are attainable"
" With a goal set up, the advertiser can track how many of the users that clickthrough to the website follow through to that goal"
" 
This is called a conversion"
"
Goals can be:
• Buying a product
• Filling in a form or quote
• Downloading a white paper
• Sending an enquiry
• Booking a flight
We know that the CTR of an advert is the number of clicks out of the total 
impressions"
"
The conversion rate of an advert is conversions divided by clicks"
"The cost per action (or the cost per each conversion) is the total cost of the 
campaign, divided by the number of conversions"
The average cost per click is the total cost of the campaign divided by the number of clicks
"
As the advertiser, you also need to know the value of each conversion"
" If the value 
of a conversion is less than the cost of achieving it, you effectively lose money with every conversion"
" Knowing the value to your business of a conversion will enable 
you to run search advertising campaigns profitably"

"2 The bidding process
 
Advertisers need to determine the maximum they are willing to pay for a click on 
their advert, and they need to decide this for each keyword they enter for an advert"
" 
This bid is the maximum cost per click (max CPC)"
"
However, this will not necessarily be the CPC that the advertiser must pay for a 
click"
" Every time a search query is entered, the search engine runs an auction to 
determine the placement of the adverts where advertisers have bid on that search term"
" This auction is known as a Generalised Second Price (GSP) auction, which is 
a variation on the Vickrey auction"
"
In the GSP auction, each advertiser will pay the bid of the advertiser below him, 
plus a standard increment (typically $0"
"01), for a click on their advert"
"
Say three advertisers, A1, A2 and A3, bid $2"
"50, $3"
00 and $2
"35 respectively on the 
same keyword"
 The search engine has set a minimum price of $2
05 on that same keyword
" Here is how the adverts would be positioned, and what they would each pay for a click:

00 $2

"3 AdWords Quality Score
 
When it comes to ranking, of course, it’s not quite as simple as that (it rarely is!)"
" 
As well as the bid an advertiser places on a keyword, the search engine will take a 
number of other factors into account"
" In the case of Google AdWords, this is known 
as Quality Score"
" Quality Score is applied on a keyword, ad group and account level"
" It is important that your entire account has a good Quality Score, as it affects ranking and the cost per click"
"
The Quality Score is determined by, among other factors:
• The relevance of the keyword to the search term"
"
• The relevance of the advert copy to the search term"
"
• The relevance of the landing page to the search term"
"
• The historic CTR of that advert"
"
Quality Score is ranked as follows:
• Great (8, 9, 10): Keyword is very relevant and QS needs no improvement"
" 
• OK (5, 6, 7): Keyword is relevant, but can still benefit from a higher QS"
" 
• Poor (1, 2, 3, 4): This keyword isn’t very relevant and QS needs 
improvement"
"
Another way to think of the Quality Score is as a discount that is applied to your 
campaign"
" For instance, an advert with a great Quality Score can achieve a top 
position at a lower bid than a competing ad with a poor Quality Score; for example, an advertiser with a Quality Score of 5 will have to pay twice as much for a certain 
position as an advertiser with a Quality Score of 10"
"
10"
"7 Tracking
 
In order to report on campaigns all the way through to conversion, you need to 
use appropriate conversion tracking"
" Conversion tracking is usually accomplished 
with a small tracking pixel that is placed on the conversion confirmation page of 
the website"
"
Google AdWords offers conversion tracking tags, which will allow you to report 
on AdWords campaigns from impression through to conversion"
" The AdWords 
interface provides a wide range of useful reports"
"In order to track many other networks, however, third-party tracking needs to be used"
 Most ad serving technology will also enable pay-per-click tracking (usually at a nominal additional cost per click)
" If you are running display campaigns through 
these networks as well, this has the benefit of reporting on how the campaigns 
might influence each other"
"
If you are sending traffic to a website that uses Google Analytics, you can use 
campaign tracking to track and report on campaigns that are driving traffic to the site"
" You can link your AdWords and Analytics accounts to share information across 
these platforms (such as the cost paid per click in Google Analytics and some basic 
analytics information in AdWords)"
"

"8 Planning and setting up a search 
advertising campaign
1"
" Do your homework
For a successful campaign, you need a full online and offline analysis of the 
business, customer demographics, industry and competitors"
" While it is relatively 
quick to set up a campaign, pre-planning will show dividends later"
" You need a 
brand, an identity and a clear, unique selling point"
" You get only three lines to advertise, so you need to make sure you know what must be included and how to make the most impact"
"
2"
" Define your goals
You need to know what you want to achieve with your search advertising campaign"
" Branding campaigns, for example, are very different from campaigns to increase 
sales"
" What do you want users to do once they click on your advert? 
3"
" Budget, cost per action (CPA) and targets
Determine how much you are willing to spend to achieve your goal – your target 
CPA"
" Decide how much budget you are going to allocate to your search advertising 
campaign"
" If your goal is to increase revenue, your budget may be unlimited as 
long as revenue is increasing and you are within your target CPA"
"
4"
" Keyword research
You need to determine what keywords potential customers are likely to use when searching for the service that you offer"
" Along with that, you need to know:
• What common misspellings a customer might use"
"
• What words would show that they are not likely to purchase from you (words such as ‘free’ and ‘cheap’)"

""
"284 285As part of your keyword research, you need to look at expected volumes for your 
keywords, so you know how to bid"
" There are also tools that will show you similar 
or related keywords, so you can expand your keyword list even further"
" See Tools 
of the trade (below) for some suggestions"
"
5"
" Write the adverts
Using your keyword research, write compelling adverts to promote your products"
" Adverts can be unique to one keyword, or you can group them and have a number 
of keywords for one advert"
" 
Make sure you use an appropriate display URL, and that you target the landing 
page for each advert"
"
6"
" Place your bids
Based on your goals and keyword research, set the maximum bids for your keywords"
" Don’t set these too high at this stage – you’ll tweak the bids as you test 
your campaign"
" That being said, don’t make them too low either, or you won’t get 
much traffic, and it could affect your Quality Score"
 Test your ad to find the right balance in line with your goals
 AdWords also provides tools that can help guide your decisions
"
7"
" Tracking
Get your tracking tags in place, especially any conversion tracking tags"
"
8"
" Measure, analyse, test, optimise!
With tracking in place, you can analyse your ROI down to a keyword level, and then focus your campaign and budget on the keywords that are converting best"
" 
Consider seeing how changing the text, image or video of your advert can increase 
the CTR, or your conversion rate"
" Test different landing pages to see what converts 
better"
"
Test the networks too"
" Your Bing campaign may perform better than Google, or 
your Facebook account may drive cheaper traffic"
" Always keep your goals in mind and work, work, work to achieve them"

"10 Advantages and challenges
 
There are many reasons why search advertising can be an excellent addition to any digital marketing strategy"
" 
• 
No to low cost barrier
You pay only for traffic; there are usually no setup fees involved; and all the 
tools you need to start out with can be accessed free"
"
• Tracking every cent
Search advertising allows you to track your advertising spend down to a 
keyword level, so you can learn what works and what doesn’t on a micro scale"
"
• Targeted advert placement
You can make your advertising relevant – by using filters, targeting your ads to 
specific people, or even in the way you use keywords and match types"

""
"286 287• You’re giving your customers what they want
Search advertising lets you put your advert in front of people who are searching 
for your product"
" It lets you provide a solution, as opposed to creating an 
interruption"
" 
Search advertising campaigns are quick to set up, can provide high volumes of 
traffic, and are highly trackable"
" But there are some pitfalls that you ought to be 
aware of"
"
• Click fraud
Click fraud occurs when your advert is clicked on by someone who is not a 
legitimate potential customer"
" Because an advertiser has to pay for every 
click, sometimes unscrupulous competitors can click on the advert to force 
the payment"
" There are even automated bots that can click on adverts, costing advertisers millions"
"
Search engines have taken measures to combat this and click fraud is no 
longer widely prevalent"
" Advertisers can report suspected click fraud, and the 
search engines will refund invalid or fraudulent clicks after investigation"
" 
What can you do? Keep an eye on your campaign"
" Any sudden leap in CTR 
should be investigated, and you should pay particular attention to see if 
the conversion rate drops (which would indicate potential fraud)"
" Pause the campaign if you suspect fraud, and alert the search engine"
"
• 
Bidding wars and climbing CPCs
High-traffic keywords are expensive, and the battle to stay on top means that the CPC of these keywords is escalating"
" Convincing yourself that it’s number 
one or nothing can result in burning through your campaign budget quickly, 
with nothing to show for it"
" 
Keep focused on your campaign goals and ROI, and keep investigating to find 
(cheaper) niche keywords that work for you"
"
• 
Keeping an eye on things
Search advertising campaigns require a lot of monitoring, and the bigger your campaign gets, the more time this takes"
" Search advertising can provide a 
fantastic ROI, but you need to check in and tweak regularly to make sure that 
it continues to perform for you"

"1 One-line summary
 
‘Sister Act’ on Broadway increased online ticket sales by using entertainment-focused video adverts"
"

11
"2 The problem
 
‘Sister Act’ on Broadway, a well-known and popular show, needed to increase ticket sales"
" Just under a third of tickets were sold on their website, SisterActBroadway"
"com, so they needed to 
increase online traffic to meet this goal"
" Apart from on their website, tickets were also being sold 
on broker sites alongside other show tickets"
 These websites were not always correctly updated or professionally laid out
 Potential theatre goers could also be distracted by competing shows and book for those instead
" If the ‘Sister Act’ Broadway website was positioned as the official site 
to buy tickets, theatre goers who set out to watch the show could purchase without distraction 
(Google, 2012)"
" 
‘Sister Act’ on Broadway teamed up with SpotCo, an entertainment advertising agency, to meet 
these challenges (Google, 2012)"
"

"3 The solution
 
SpotCo needed to bring the entertainment aspect of Broadway to an online audience to entice them to book"
"  For their online efforts, the agency chose to draw theatre goers with Media Ads 
(Google, 2012)"
" 
Media Ads are video ads served on Google, specifically designed for the entertainment industry"
" 
They are also unique in that instead of selecting keywords, Google’s automated process serves ads 
to users whose search queries match the advert title"
" These adverts are also charged at a flat-rate cost per click, unlike most search advertising, where advertisers bid on key phrases (Google, n"
d
)
" 
These video ads can be viewed in high definition and expand to fill much of the viewer’s screen, 
greying out the background to hold the viewer’s attention"
" These ads are displayed in the top 
position, occupying more real estate than regular search ads"
" This space was used to deliver key 
messages, including pertinent information and a preview thumbnail (Google, 2012)"
"  
Other promotional efforts included cast changes, a TV promotion, a ‘Nun Run’ flashmob in Central 
Park and a confessional booth in-theatre where theatre goers could share their ‘Sister Act’ experience (Google, 2012)"

Search advertising is an excellent source of keywords and conversions"

to improve the SEO of a site, as you will already know the relevance of these keywords to your intended audience"
" In turn, improved SEO rankings and social media interactions can help to 
reduce the CPC of your search advertising campaign, improve your Quality Score and raise your 
CTRs throughout"
"
Search advertising can also help to give your brand immediate search engine presence for your 
offline campaigns, when these might not yet be highly ranked in the natural search results"
 Search advertising can also be used together with online crisis management
" If a company is unable 
to combat negative search results through the natural rankings, they are always able to bid for 
search adverts that can present their view"
"
Having a firm grasp of search advertising on search engines will provide a good foundation for 
running digital advertising campaigns across other networks and ad types"

"13 Summary
 
Search advertising is advertising on the results pages of search engines where an advertiser typically pays for each click on an advert"
" These adverts consist of text, links and Ad Extensions"
" 
They are listed above and alongside the organic search results, and are marked as adverts so that 
users are aware that these are paid-for listings"
"
Search advertising is targeted according to keywords, demographics, behaviour or interest"
" On 
search engines, the CPC is determined by an auction"
"
The success of an advert may be determined by its CTR, but the success of a campaign will be 
determined by its conversion rate and its ability to achieve a target CPA"
" After all, it’s not enough 
for people just to click on your adverts – you want them to take specific actions on your site once 
they get there"

"1 Introduction
 
Online advertising, simply put, is advertising on the Internet"
" Online advertising 
encompasses display adverts found on websites, adverts on search engine results 
pages (covered in the chapter on Search Advertising), adverts placed in emails 
and on social networks, and other ways in which advertisers use the Internet"
" 
Of course, this is not just limited to computers – digital advertising can be found anywhere you access the web, for example, through mobile devices"
"
The main objectives of online advertising are to increase sales, improve brand 
awareness and raise share of voice in the marketplace"
" It is based on the simple 
economics of demand and supply"
 Advertisers aim to stimulate a consumer need (demand) and then satisfy that need (supply)
" 
Online advertising, naturally, follows web user behaviour"
" Advertisers want to 
place their adverts where potential customers will see them"
" Digital advertising is 
not limited to one specific medium or location – it can be placed almost anywhere 
on the web and can consist of images, text, videos, interactive elements, and even games"
" 
Although the Internet provides new scope for creative approaches to advertising, we 
see its true advantages when we realise how trackable (and therefore measurable) 
Internet advertising is"
" It is possible to track all interactions with the advert itself: 
the number of impressions served, how many clicks it received, post-click-and-view data, and how many unique users were reached"
" This leads to valuable data that can be used to make sensible, effective business decisions"
"
In this chapter, you will learn:
• The various business objectives you can meet with online advertising
• All about the various ad formats, payment models and ad types available
• How and where to publish your adverts
• How to run an online advertising campaign step by step

"3 Online advertising objectives
Advertising, whether online or offline, has a number of objectives"
"
11"
3
"1 Building brand awareness
 
Making people aware of a brand or product is an important long-term goal for any 
marketer"
" Once customers know about it, they are more likely to trust the brand"
" 
The better known a brand is, the more business it can do"
" And the ultimate goal is 
to sell more of the product or service"
"
Online advertising is largely visual, making it an ideal channel for promoting brand 
imagery and making people familiar with its colours, logo and overall feel"
"

"2 Creating demand
 
Creating customer demand is a three-step process: inform, persuade and remind"
" 
Customers can’t want what they don’t know about"
" Advertising needs to convince 
them about what they should want and why they should want it"
" Online advertising 
provides a great way to communicate the unique selling points (USPs) of a product, helping to stimulate demand and reminding customers about the product and why they want it"
"

"

"3 Satisfying demand
 
Once somebody wants a product, they need to find out how to satisfy that desire"
" 
At this point it is important for the marketer to show the customer how their 
particular brand or product will best meet that need"
"

"4 Driving direct response and sales
 
All forms of digital marketing need to drive traffic and sales in the long term"
" 
However, the immediacy of online advertising also drives traffic and sales in the 
short and medium terms"
" Unlike traditional media advertising, online advertising 
can turn the potential customer into an actual customer right there and then"
" What’s more, it is possible to measure accurately how effective the online advertising campaign has been in this regard"
"
11"
"4 The key differentiator
 
Online advertising is able to drive instant sales and conversions"
" Unlike other advertising mediums, the consumer can go from advert to merchant in one easy 
click"
" Because of the connected nature of the Internet, online activities are highly 
trackable and measurable, which makes it possible to target adverts and to track and gauge the efficacy of the advertising accurately"
 Each display advert can be tracked for success
"
11"
"5 Types of display adverts
 
There are many different ways to display adverts online"
 Here are some of the most common options
"
11"
5
"1 Banner adverts
 
A banner advert is a graphic image or animation displayed on a website for advertising purposes"
" Static banners are in GIF or JPEG format, but banners can also employ rich media such as Flash, video, JavaScript, HTML5 and other 
interactive technologies; these allow the viewer to interact and transact within 
the banner"
 Banners are not limited to the space that they occupy; some banners expand on mouse-over or when clicked
"Standard banner sizes
There are standard sizes (measured in pixels) for static, animated and rich media banner adverts"
" Creating banners in these sizes means the ads can be placed 
on many websites (advertisers sell space in these sizes as well)"
" And here, size 
(both dimensions and file size) does matter – you can expect varying rates of clickthroughs and conversions across the range of sizes"
" Bigger is usually better, but if you want to know what works best for your brand, test"
"
Banner sizes available on the Google Display Network include (all sizes are in 
pixels):
• Banner (468 x 60) 
• Mobile leaderboard (300 x 50)
• Leaderboard (728 x 90) 
• Small Square (200 x 200) 
• Skyscraper (120 x 600) 
• Wide Skyscraper (160 x 600) 
• Square (250 x 250) 
• Medium Rectangle (300 x 250) 
• Large Rectangle (336 x 280)
 
Banners may be animated, static or Flash, but must be under 50k in file size"
"
Bear in mind that the advertising network often includes a small graphic overlay 
on the bottom of the advert, and does not resize your advert to accommodate this"
" To avoid this obscuring your advert, you can leave a few pixels of blank space on 
the bottom of your advert"
"
All adverts need to be supplied with a destination URL"
" Some rich media adverts 
allow for multiple destination URLs"
"
11"
5
"2 Interstitial banners
 
These are banners shown between pages on a website"
" As you click from one page to another, you are shown this advert before the next page is displayed"
" Sometimes 
the advert can be closed"
"
NOTE
Google AdWords offers 
a rich media banner advert builder"
 You can find it in the ‘Ads’ tab in the AdWords account interface
"
NOTE
Start with the most common banner size"

"3 Popups and pop-unders
 
As the name suggests, these are adverts that pop up, or under, the web page being 
viewed"
" They open in a new, smaller window"
" You will see a popup straight away, 
but will probably become aware of a pop-under only after you close your browser 
window"
"
These were very prominent in the early days of online advertising, but audience 
annoyance means that there are now ‘popup blockers’ built into most good web browsers"
 This can be problematic as sometimes a website will legitimately use a popup to display information to the user
"
11"
5
"4 Floating adverts 
 
This advert appears in a layer over the content, but is not in a separate window"
" Usually, the user can close this advert"
" In fact, best practice dictates that a 
prominent close button should be included on the advert, usually in the top right 
hand corner"
" Floating adverts are created with DHTML or Flash, and float in a layer above a site’s content for a few seconds"
" Often, the animation ends by disappearing into a banner advert on the page"
"
Figure 4"
" An expanded banner ad, including video, on the Los Angeles Times 
website"

5
"5 Wallpaper adverts
 
This advert changes the background of the web page being viewed"
" It is sometimes 
possible to click on an advert of this type, but not always"
" The effect of these adverts 
is difficult to measure as there is often no clickthrough, and its chief purpose is 
branding"
11
5
"6 Map adverts
 
This is advertising placed on an online map, such as Google Maps"
" This type of advert is ideal for local businesses and is usually based on keyword searches for 
the brand’s offering"
"
Figure 5"

"
11"
"6 Payment models for display advertising
 
As well as a variety of mediums and formats, there are also a number of different 
payment models for display advertising"
"
11"
6
"1 CPM 
 
CPM stands for cost per thousand impressions (M is the Roman numeral for a thousand)"
" This means the advertiser pays for every thousand times the advert 
loads on the publisher’s page"
" This is how a campaign is normally priced when 
brand awareness or exposure is the primary goal"
" 
CPM rates for rich media adverts are usually higher than for standard media 
adverts"
 This is often based on file size
"
11"
6
"2 CPC
 
CPC stands for cost per click"
" This means that the advertiser pays only when their advert is clicked on by an interested party, regardless of how many times it has 
been viewed"
" CPC advertising is normally associated with search advertising, 
Online Advertising  ›  Payment models for display advertising Online Advertising  ›  Types of display adverts
NOTE
Remember: your goal is 
to inform and motivate 
customers, not annoy 
them"
""
"302 303although it has become very popular in display advertising too, especially when 
using ad networks"
" Banners can be priced this way when the aim is to drive 
traffic and conversions"
" It is also a payment method sometimes used in affiliate 
marketing, when the aim is to drive traffic to a new website"
" 
11"
6
"3 CPA
 
CPA refers to cost per acquisition"
" This model means that the advertiser pays 
only when an advert delivers an acquisition after the user clicks on the advert"
" 
Definitions of acquisitions vary depending on the site and campaign"
" It may be a user filling in a form, downloading a file or buying a product"
" 
CPA is often the best option for advertisers because they pay only when the 
advertising has met its goal"
" For this reason, it is also the worst type for the publisher, as they are rewarded only if the advertising is successful"
" The publisher 
has to rely on the conversion rate of the advertiser’s website, something that 
the publisher cannot control"
 The CPA model is not commonly used for banner advertising and is generally associated with affiliate marketing
" 
11"
6
"4 Flat rate or sponsorships
 
Sometimes, owners of lower-traffic sites choose to sell banner space at a flat rate – in other words, at a fixed cost per month, regardless of the amount of traffic 
or impressions"
" This would appeal to a media buyer who may be testing an online 
campaign that targets niche markets"
"
There are several variations to what a sponsorship on a website entails"
" Examples 
include exclusive adverts on all the pages and slots on a specific page, newsletter or section, and sponsoring content"
" Sponsorship means that no other advertiser 
will appear in that section"
" Sponsorships are often difficult to measure and are 
mostly used to raise brand awareness"
 These can be very effective when launching a new brand
"
11"
6
"5 CPE
 
With the cost per engagement (CPE) model, advertisers pay for interactions with adverts, normally placed in videos or applications (such as Facebook applications)"
" 
An interaction, referred to as an engagement, usually starts with a rollover (or 
mouse-over) that expands the ad"
" Once expanded, an advert may contain a video, 
game, form, or other interactive content"
" The ad doesn’t take the user away from 
the web page, and marketers pay only when an individual completes an action"
11
6
"6 What payment model can you expect?
 
The advertiser rarely has a say over the payment model used – this comes down to the website owner or publisher, advertising type and other factors, such as the 
popularity of the site"
" 
CPM favours the publisher, while CPA favours the advertiser"
" Sometimes, a hybrid 
of the two payment models is pursued"
"
High-traffic, broad-audience websites (often referred to as ‘premium’ or booked 
media) will typically offer CPM advertising"
" Examples include web portals such as 
www"
yahoo
com or news sites such as www
cnn
com
"
Niche websites with a targeted audience are more likely to offer CPC or CPA advertising to advertisers with an appropriate product"
" These can also fall under 
the umbrella of affiliate marketing"
"
Types of advertising can be seen on a scale from more intrusive (and thus potentially 
annoying to the consumer) to less intrusive"
" In the same way, payment models can be scaled from those that favour the publisher to those that favour the advertiser"
"
When planning a campaign, it is important to know how the advertising will be 
paid for and what kinds of advertising are offered by publishers"
" A lot of this can 
be solved by using a company that specialises in advert serving, media planning and media buying"
"
11"
"7 Getting your ads online
 
To get your ads to appear online, you need to find and pay for the space where it will appear"
" There are several options for doing this: 
• Premium booked media
• Advertising networks
• Advertising exchanges
• Social media advertising placements
• Mobile advertising
• Ad servers
11"
7
"1 Premium booked media
 
Premium booked media works very much in the traditional way of booking advertising – the advertiser contacts the premium media provider (usually a single 
group that oversees a key, high-profile online space) and discusses options for 
placing an advert"
" This will involve negotiating on targeting and pricing for the space desired, and is usually a costly but high-profile option"

"2 Advertising networks
 
An advertising network is a group of websites on which adverts can be purchased 
through a single sales entity"
" It could be a collection of sites owned by the same 
publisher (for example, New Line Cinema, Time Inc"
" and HBO are all owned by 
Time Warner Inc"
) or it could be an affiliation of sites that share a representative
 The Google Display Network is one of the largest advertising networks in the world
"
Figure 6"
 Ad formats available on the Google Display Network
"
The advertising network acts as an intermediary between advertisers and 
publishers, and provides a technology solution to both"
" As well as providing a 
centralised ad server that can serve adverts to a number of websites, the networks offer tracking and reporting, as well as targeting"
" 
Advertising networks usually categorise the sites by factors such as demographics, 
topic, or area of interest"
" Advertisers pay to advertise in specific channels, and not 
in individual sites"
" Most times, the campaign will then be optimised based on the 
best converting sites"
"
Rates are often negotiated with the network, and placements are booked over a 
period of time"
"
11"
7
"3 Advertising exchanges
 
Advertising exchanges, on the other hand, are where unsold advertising space – called inventory – is placed by publishers for bidding"
" The inventory is sold to 
the highest bidding advertiser"
" Giving advertisers far more control, this type of 
advertising mimics the PPC model of search advertising (Generalised Second Price auction) – but bids are for audience profiles and space rather than for keywords"
" 
It allows publishers to fill unsold inventory at the highest available price, and can 
give smaller advertisers access to this inventory"
11
7
"4 Social media advertising
 
Many social media platforms offer an advertising option, as this is their primary source of revenue"
" Social media can be an excellent place to reach prospects 
because you can usually target very accurately based on user-provided 
demographic information"
"
Facebook
Facebook offers four paid-for advertising solutions: 
1"
" Facebook Ads are standard adverts that appear in the user’s right-hand 
sidebar"
 They have no minimum spend and can be bought on either a cost per thousand impressions (CPM) or cost per click (CPC) basis
" These 
adverts are served based on interests and demographic information"
" 
For example, an advertiser can request to have their advert shown to all women in London who are interested in men, who are single and between 
the ages of 25 and 35, and who like dogs or puppies"
"
Figure 7"
 Targeting options on Facebook
"
2"
" Facebook Engagement Ads are similar to standard ads, but include 
an element that fans can engage with, such as a Like or Share button, a video, an event, or a poll"
" These are bought on a CPM basis with a 
minimum spend threshold"
"
3"
" Sponsored stories are posts that are created whenever someone engages with a specific element of the brand’s Facebook Page; these 
then appear in their connections’ news feeds"
" You allocate a budget to the 
specific post, and this is spent to have the ad appear"
" 
4"
 Promoted posts allow you to publicise an existing post that you have made
" 
A page must have at least 400 Likes before this option becomes available"

Twitter
Twitter offers a self-service ad platform with several options and allows a degree 
of specific targeting"
" The service is still relatively new, which means that it changes 
frequently, and not all options may be available to all regions or user accounts"
"
• Promoted tweets are tweets that appear at the very top of a user’s timeline, or in Twitter mobile apps"
" There is no minimum spend, and 
advertisers pay when users retweet, @reply to, favourite or click on a promoted tweet"
"
• Promoted accounts are user accounts that appear on the left of the 
user’s Twitter timeline, in the section called “Who to follow”, which 
recommends accounts the user may like"
" Advertisers pay when a user 
follows the promoted account"
"
Figure 9"
 A Promoted account on Twitter 
"
• Promoted trends is available only to full-service Twitter Ads customers 
and allows a brand to list their brand name, hashtag or slogan in the 
left-hand ‘Trends’ section of a user’s Twitter timeline, which is usually 
reserved for the most popular topics of the moment on Twitter"
" These generally have a flat fee and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, 
depending on how wide the geographic targeting is"
"YouTube
YouTube offers a wide range of advertising formats and options for businesses"
" 
These are covered in detail in the chapter on video marketing"
" 
LinkedIn
LinkedIn Ads is a self-service advertising platform that allows you to create and place adverts on prominent pages on the LinkedIn website, including a user’s 
home page, search results pages, groups and more"
" There are many targeting 
options available, including job title, job function, industry, geography, age, gender, 
company name, company size, and LinkedIn Group"
" There is a minimum budget 
requirement of $10 a day (though no minimum spend), and ads can be served on a CPM or CPC basis"
"

"5 Mobile advertising
 
There are three types of mobile networks that you can choose from when 
embarking on a mobile advertising campaign"
" 
Blind networks
These networks target a large number of independent mobile publishers, and generally allow you to target by country or type of content, but not by specific 
websites"
" Payment tends to be on a CPC basis, which can vary"
" An example of this 
kind of network is BuzzCity (www"

"308 309Premium blind networks
Advertising on premium blind networks tends to be more expensive, but allow 
the advertiser to target better-known brands and high-traffic sites"
" Broadcasters 
or operator portals fall under this category"
" Payment here is often on a CPM 
basis"
 Millennial Media (www

com) is an example premium blind network
" While targeting options are available, different networks can work in different ways, with varying levels of support"
"
Premium networks
These networks often offer sales as a direct extension of the big brands that they offer"
" More detailed targeting and sales support is available, but they also charge higher 
rates"

"6 Ad servers
 
Ad servers are servers that store advertisements and serve them to web pages"
" 
Ad servers can be local, run by a publisher to serve adverts to websites on the 
publisher’s domain, or they can be third-party ad servers, which serve adverts 
to web pages on any domain"
 Ad servers facilitate advert trafficking and provide reports on advert performance
" They have two functions: to help publishers manage their ad inventory, and to help advertisers monitor and optimise their campaigns"
"The benefits of ad servers
Rather than distribute copies of each piece of creative advertising to each publisher or media buyer, you can send out a line of code that calls up an advertisement 
directly from the ad server each time an advert is scheduled to run"
" The agency 
loads the creative to the server once and can modify rotations or add new units on the fly without needing to re-contact the vendors"
 This is referred to as third-party ad serving
"
The ad servers provide a wealth of data, including impressions served, adverts 
clicked, CTR and CPC"
" While publishers have their own ad servers, most of the third-party ad servers also have the ability to provide performance against post-click activities such as sales, leads, downloads, or any other site-based action the 
advertiser may want to measure"
"
Ad servers provide a consistent counting methodology across the entire campaign 
enabling the advertiser to gain an ‘apples to apples’ comparison of performance across the entire media schedule, which includes multiple websites"
" This ensures that the advertiser gets what they are paying for, and avoids fraudulent activities, 
such as click fraud, as a good third-party ad server should be audited"
"
The ad server also allows sophisticated targeting of display advertising"
" Examples 
of third-party ad servers include Google DoubleClick, Atlas and MediaMind"
"
 
11"
"8 Targeting and optimising
 
Ad servers serve adverts across a number of websites, and can track a user 
visiting websites using cookies or IP addresses"
" This means that ad servers can 
offer advertisers:
• Frequency capping: this limits the number of times a specific user sees 
the same advert in a set time period"
"
• Sequencing: this ensures that a user sees adverts in a particular order"
"
• Exclusivity: this ensures that adverts from direct competitors are not shown on the same page"
"
• Roadblocks: this allows an advertiser to own 100% of the advertising 
inventory on a page"
"
NOTE
The Mobile Marketing 
Association publishes a 
set of useful guidelines

"310 311The ad server can also target adverts based on the business rules of the advertiser 
or the profiles of the users:
• Geo-targeting: online advertising has the ability to target markets by country, province or city, and can even drill them down to something as 
specific as their IP address"
 This is also known as IP targeting
"
• Network or browser type: markets can further be targeted via 
networks or browser types such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari"
"
• Connection type: users can be segmented and targeted according to their Internet connection type, for example, whether they use 
broadband or dial-up connections"
"
• Day and time: advertisers can choose the time of day or day of the week when their adverts are shown"
" Advertisers can specify when their 
campaign should flight, down to the minute"
 This usually depends on the client’s objective for the campaign or the product itself
"
• Social serving: websites gather demographic data about users and then serve each user targeted and relevant advertising"
" For example, Facebook will allow advertisers to select specific characteristics of 
users who will be shown an advert"
"
• Behavioural targeting: the ad server uses the profile of a user (built up over websites visited previously) to determine which adverts to show 
during a given visit"
 Ad servers can base this profile on cookies or on IP addresses
" For example, the ad server may choose to show adverts 
for pet insurance on a news page to a user who has visited the pets and 
animals section of a general media site previously"
" 
Re-marketing is another form of behavioural targeting"
" This allows 
the ad server to display ads to users after they have interacted with a website in a certain way – for example, by adding an item to their cart 
on an eCommerce page but not checking out"
" The user may then see an 
ad for the product they have in their cart, to encourage them to go back and make a purchase"
"
Another approach to behavioural targeting is to set up parameters to 
determine when a certain advert needs to be shown"
" For example: if the 
user has clicked on a banner advertising a test drive, and the user has 
actually booked the test drive, the next time they see an advert from the advertiser, a different advert will be shown because the user has 
already responded to the first one"
"• Contextual advertising: the ad server deduces the optimum adverts to 
serve based on the content of the page"
" For example, on an article about 
mountain bike holidays in Europe, the ad server would show adverts for 
new mountain bikes, or adverts from travel companies offering flights 
to Europe, or perhaps adverts for adventure travel insurance"
"
11"
"9 Tracking
 
The trackability of online advertising is what makes it so superior to conventional advertising"
" Not only can an advertiser tell how many times an advert has been 
seen (impressions), but also how many times the advert has been successful in 
sending visitors to the advertised website (clicks)"
" As discussed in the chapter on conversion optimisation, the tracking needs to continue on the website to determine how successful the advert has been in creating more revenue for the 
website (conversions)"
"
As well as tracking adverts, advertising networks can also provide information 
about the people who saw the advert, as well as those who acted on it, including:
• Connection type 
• Browser
• Operating system
• Time of day
• Internet service provider
Many third-party ad servers will set a cookie on impression of an advert, not only on clickthrough, so it is possible to track conversions that happen indirectly (called view-through conversions)"
" Simply put, third-party ad servers can track not only 
the post click data, but also the post view data: when a user sees an advert, does 
not click on it, but goes to the website after viewing the advert (either by typing in the URL, or by searching for the site)"
"
Using this information, the ad server can target the adverts displayed, helping 
advertisers to optimise campaigns and get the most from their budgets"

 Determine the goal of your campaign
" 
Are you embarking on a branding campaign, or is your primary focus direct 
response?
2"
 Identify your key performance indicators (KPIs)
"
Which figures will let you know if you are succeeding? This should tie in closely to your goal"
"
3"
 Investigate your target audience
" 
What websites are they likely to be visiting? The type of creative you use and the payment model you follow will largely be determined by the websites that 
you advertise on"
"
Online advertising is an acquisition and awareness channel"
" It does not 
require users to seek an interaction actively, as search advertising and email 
marketing do"
" So, it is crucial that the adverts are placed in front of the audience that is most likely to convert"
"
4"
 Research potential websites to host your adverts
"
Niche websites with a smaller, more targeted audience will most likely 
charge a flat rate for display advertising, or a CPA rate"
" They could be flexible 
in display options that they give you, but you will need to take into account their bandwidth costs if they serve the adverts"
"
High-traffic websites with a broad audience will usually charge on a CPM 
basis"
" They will broker their advertising inventory through an advertising 
network, or even a number of advertising networks"
" 
5"
 Set a budget
"
Most advertising platforms will let you set and dynamically manage your 
budget"
" Decide how much you are willing to pay per click, impression, action 
or engagement, and set your total budget in line with this"
"
6"
 Create your adverts
"
Now, you will need to brief your creative team to ensure that you have the 
optimum banners for your campaign"
"
Your online adverts will need to:
• Attract attention
• Convey a message
• Entice actionAnimation attracts attention, but be wary of being one of several animated 
banners on a website"
" Banners should not be considered in isolation, but 
rather in the context of the website on which they will appear"
"
Web users respond well to being told what to do, and the content of an online 
advert should be concise and directional"
" Examples of these CTAs include:
• “Phone now for the best deals on insurance"
"”
• “Click here for fast home delivery"
"”
• “Donate now"
"”
7"
 Choose or create a landing page
"
All advertising needs an appropriate landing page or destination URL"
" Whether this involves creating a microsite, or merely leading users to an existing page 
on the website, ensure that clickthroughs are not being wasted"
" Generally, 
sending advertising traffic to your home page is not a good idea as it leaves the user confused about where to go next"
"
8"
 Run your adverts
"
Now that you’re all set up, you can let your ads go live! Keep a close eye on your spending to ensure that you’re getting a decent return for your money, 
and that nothing unusual is occurring"
"
9"
" Track, measure, optimise"
"
As with all online marketing tactics, you need to track what your ads are doing 
and the results they are generating, measure your returns and successes, and 
then optimise your online advertising campaigns to get even better returns in 
future"
"
11"
"11 The future of online advertising
 
On the web, the convergence of digital devices and channels is leading to new avenues for online advertising"
" Digital advertising can reach customers anywhere 
where they can access the web"
"
While we have become used to the Internet as a free medium where we can 
read and interact with any content we want, it is the fact that it is an advertiser’s 
medium that keeps it free"
" And that means that as technologies evolve and the way 
we interact with content changes, so advertising follows"
"Online Advertising  ›  The future of online advertising Online Advertising  ›  Step-by-step guide to online advertising

If a problem comes up, 
you can simply stop your campaign, change the creative elements or modify your approach - the beauty of online advertising is that it can be revised almost instantly"
""
"314 315Previously the level of interaction a web user had with a website could be measured 
by the number of pages of that website the user viewed"
" Now, technology such 
as AJAX and rich media such as video mean that the time spent on a web page 
can be more meaningful than the number of pages viewed"
" The key word here is ‘engagement’, and technology and data analysis is working towards being able to determine how websites can quantify the level of engagement with a viewer"
"
A little online research will reveal plenty of commentary declaring the decline of 
display advertising"
" Increasingly, consumers are becoming both weary and wary 
of advertising"
" Clickthrough rates on banners are dropping, so the effectiveness of display advertising is being questioned by some"
" With the focus in digital marketing on tracking and measuring response and engagement, should a company spend 
money on less measurable activities such as ‘brand building’, where they are 
paying on a CPM basis?
Using third-party ad servers and post-impression tracking, the effect of different 
advertising and marketing channels on each other can be observed"
" Banner advertising can see an increase in search volume, for example"
" 
What does this tell us? Measurement should take place across all channels, and 
no channel should be utilised in isolation"
 The best results will be gained through an integrated and holistic approach to digital marketing

"12 Advantages and challenges

"1 Advantages of online advertising
 
Banner advertising goes a long way towards bridging the advertising divide"
" Adverts have a set size, they can look very similar to print adverts, and they occupy 
a particular bit of real estate in a publication with a particular number of views"
" It’s 
easy to understand, and it does the things with which buyers are familiar"
" 
Online advertising can take advantage of the emotive qualities of images, videos 
and animations"
 Some campaigns are better suited to images rather than plain text
" 
Since banners can contain rich media, they offer levels of interactivity that other 
forms of advertising cannot achieve"
" This allows your target market not only to see 
your banner, but also to play with it"
" Interaction builds a bond and improves the 
chances of the consumer remembering your brand tomorrow"
" Cognitive learning 
is a powerful outcome of interactive display advertising"
"
Modern online advertising is able to bring together a number of other online 
marketing tactics such as animations, games, video and Flash"
"Banner ads, like all digital marketing tactics, are measurable"
" Track clickthrough rates and you get an idea of exactly how many people are responding to your Call 
to Action"
" Some publishers even have the ability to do post-click tracking, which means that you can track the user all the way to a sale if that is the purpose of the advert"
"
11"
12
"2 Challenges of online advertising
 
A lot of display advertising is intrusive, so popup blockers can often prevent adverts from being served as they were intended by the advertisers"
" There are 
also extensions available for web browsers, such as AdBlock Plus, that will block 
advertising on web pages"
 Technologically savvy consumers are increasingly using these methods to limit the advertising that they see
"
Bandwidth can also be an issue, although this is a shrinking problem"
" However, 
campaigns should be planned according to demographics in determining the 
richness (and investment) of interaction"
" 
Consumers are suffering from advertising fatigue, so while new technologies 
can provide great results, as soon as the market moves mainstream it can get 
saturated"
 Consumers are increasingly ignoring adverts

Since the idea for the second Prius had been conceived, debate had surrounded the question of 
what exactly the term for the plural of Prius would be (Walsh, 2013)"
" The Saatchi team identified 
this as a potential talking point among customers and launched the ‘Prius goes plural’ campaign"
"Online Advertising  ›  Case study – Toyota Prius Online Advertising  ›  The future of online advertising

if your campaign is 
focused around raising 
awareness"
""
"316 317The promotional video posted on YouTube asked fans what they thought the plural of the name 
‘Prius’ should be"
 The video then gave social media users a month to vote for the best term
" 
In order to drive awareness and interest in the campaign, they created a series of animated, 
interactive display ads"
" 
Some of the display ads featured animated Prius vehicles that sped into life by driving across the 
page into the text that the viewer was reading"

• The YouTube video alone was viewed over 250 000 times, with almost 300 comments 
(ToyotaUSA, 2011)"
" 
• The Facebook Page received over 400 000 likes with 1 141 likes for a single post, although comments on posts were lacking (Toyota Prius, 2000)"

• The hashtag #PriusGoesPlural trended on Twitter"
"
• The campaign received just 1"
"2 million votes – and the Prius plural was announced as Prii (Walsh, 2013)"

Offline advertising and marketing campaigns can be adapted for an online audience in order to ensure maximum brand exposure"
" It is very effective in enhancing offline marketing and 
advertising activity and in ensuring a wider reach"
"
As mentioned, online advertising can be used as an acquisition channel, reaching out to a new 
audience"
" It can be used to initiate a buying cycle and customer relationship, which then plays out 
across other online channels"
" Addressing advertising and other channels to complement each other will result in a consistent message, and optimum results"
" Online advertising can be used to 
reach a large audience, and then other digital marketing tactics can be used to refine and engage 
this audience further"
 Social media advertising in particular is crucial for building communities and keeping the brand top of mind
"
Online advertising and affiliate marketing go hand in hand"
" Affiliate networks also act as advertising 
networks, allowing for advertising to be purchased on a performance basis"
"
When seeding new products and viral campaigns, display advertising can be used to reach a wide 
audience at a low cost"
" It can expose a campaign to many new users, and increase the chance that 
those who are most likely to pass on a message receive it in the first place"
" Display advertising also 
supports other advertising and marketing channels, such as search advertising and marketing"

"1 Introduction
If you recommend a restaurant to a friend, and that friend visits the restaurant 
because of your recommendation, the restaurant’s revenue will have increased 
because of your referral"
 This is ‘word of mouth’ marketing
" But you, as the 
referrer, do not see any of the cash benefit that the restaurant does"
"
Imagine that the restaurant gave you 10% of the bill for every person you referred"
" 
They would be paying you a finder’s fee for new customers"
 There are a number of businesses that market in this way offline
" Brokers for insurance products are 
an example, but these referrals can be hard to track"
" Online, they are very easy to 
track"
" This system of reward, where compensation is based on referral, is called affiliate marketing, and this term is used to describe this type of marketing in an online environment"

"3 The building blocks of affiliate marketing
 
The core of affiliate marketing is a simple process:
1"
" An affiliate refers potential customers to a merchant’s website or other 
offsite destination (such as a Facebook tab)"
"
2"
 Some of those customers perform a desired action
"
3"
 The merchant rewards the affiliate for each desired action that results from the affiliate’s referral
Affiliate Marketing  ›  The building blocks of affiliate marketing Affiliate Marketing  ›  Introduction
324 325Figure 1
 The affiliate marketing process
"
However, there are many different ways in which an affiliate might market a 
merchant’s offering; there are many different actions that can be rewarded; and, most importantly, there needs to be some way to keep track of the whole process"
"
12"
3
"1 Action and reward 
 
Affiliate marketing can be used to promote any type of website – there just needs to be an agreed-upon action resulting in an affiliate earning commission"
" Different 
types of merchants will have different required actions"
" The actions and the type of 
commission can be summed up as:
• Cost per Action (CPA) – a fixed commission for a particular action"
"
• Cost per Lead (CPL) – a fixed commission for a lead (that is, a potential sale)"
"
• Revenue share (also CPS or Cost per Sale) – an agreed-on percentage of the 
purchase amount"
"
• Cost per Click (CPC) – a fixed amount for each clickthrough to the website (although this forms a very small part of the affiliate marketing mix)"
"
Let’s look at an example of each of the first three actions above:
CPA
Here, the action could be anything from downloading a white paper or software to 
signing up to a newsletter"
" CPL
Merchants who offer CPL commissions are usually those who need to convert a lead into a sale offline"
" This means they will generally need to complete the 
transaction over the phone with the customer, or that the process is quite 
complicated"
" Typically, insurance companies and banking institutions offer this type of commission"
" Membership sites that offer a free trial period, such as online DVD rental, can also use this commission structure"
"
You may be wondering why merchants are willing to pay for a lead, instead of only 
for completed transactions"
" 
Affiliates prefer this model, as they are not in control of the offline conversion 
process"
 It is the merchant’s job to be able to complete the transaction
 Some merchants may be wary that the leads will not be of a high enough quality
" This is 
why they will usually have conversion targets with which the leads generated need 
to comply as a quality control"
"
Revenue share
Revenue sharing is the ideal commission structure as both the merchant and the affiliate are rewarded for performance – the more sales, the more revenue 
generated for the merchant, and the more commission for the affiliate"
" Websites 
where a sale can be performed instantly are ideal for revenue sharing"
 Online retailers and instant online travel agents are perfect examples of merchants who offer a revenue share commission
 The affiliate earns a percentage of the sale
"
Merchants tend to structure their commission offering so that affiliates who 
perform better earn a higher commission"
"
For example, a merchant may offer the following tiers of commission:
• 1–10 sales: 10% commission
• 11–25 sales: 11% commission
• 26–50 sales: 12% commission
• 51 or more sales: 15% commission
We have seen that there are different types of actions that can result in commission 
being awarded, and that these usually suit the website that is being promoted"
" 
This means that any industry that is online can most likely be promoted through 
affiliate marketing"
" 
Affiliates have many options open to them to promote merchants’ websites"
" But 
before we get to that, we need to take a look at tracking – the thread that holds it 
all together"

"2 Tracking 
 
The key to affiliate marketing is being able to track the whole process from 
potential customers being sent to a website through to a completed action, so that 
the merchant is able to award the correct affiliate with the correct commission"
" 
Specialised affiliate tracking software is used to track affiliate campaigns, and this 
is usually supplied and supported by an affiliate network"
" Often, the merchant and 
the affiliate will also use their own tracking software to make sure that there are no major discrepancies"
"
Affiliates send traffic to merchants through links or URLs, and the tracking 
software allows each affiliate to have a unique identifier in the URL"
" These links set a cookie on the customer’s computer, which allows the software to track the 
sale"
"
For example, here is the URL of a product on a retailer’s website:
http://www"
firebox
"com/product/1201
Here is the URL for the same product, but with affiliate tracking:
http://scripts"

" It has been shown in bold in 
the URL:
• The affiliate network – Affiliate Future
• The ID of the affiliate (238)
• The ID of the merchant (214)
• The ID of the programme (3897) (a merchant may have more than one programme on a network)
• The media used (0)
• The destination of the click
 
Can you spot the original URL in the one with the tracking?
When the customer completes the required action on the merchant’s website, 
the cookie will allow the tracking software to collect the information needed to 
award the commission"
" For example, if a customer were to use an affiliate link to purchase a gift from a merchant (using the same URL as before), the following 
information would be collected:
• Referring URL and affiliate
• Total sale amount for commission
• Date and time of sale
• Unique order number of sale
 
All this information will allow the merchant to confirm that the sale is valid, as well as the amount of commission that is due, without ever releasing any of the 
customer’s personal information"
"
Affiliate tracking software collects information even if no action is completed"
" This 
is vital to the affiliates and to the merchants to see where they can optimise their 
campaign"
"
Information collected includes:
• Impressions
• Clicks
• Conversions
 
All this information helps to build up data in order to strengthen the campaign"

" Cookies are not just used 
for affiliate marketing"
" They are also used to store information so that a website 
‘remembers’ who you are next time you visit it"
" The domain owner gets to determine 
how long a cookie should last"
 This is called the cookie period
"
When it comes to affiliate marketing, it is up to the merchant to decide what the 
cookie period should be"
 The affiliate is awarded commission only if the desired action takes place within the cookie period
" Some merchants make the cookie last 
for the session only (that is, if the user leaves the website, comes back the same 
day, and then makes the purchases, no commission is rewarded)"
" The standard cookie period for affiliate marketing is 30 days, although higher-value items with longer purchase considerations, such as package holidays abroad, can last as long 
as 90 days"
" 
There are merchants who offer what is called an affiliate lock-in"
" Here, the first 
affiliate to refer the customer earns commission for the lifetime of the customer: 
every purchase that the customer makes will earn the affiliate commission"
"
Affiliates tend to prefer a longer cookie period; it increases the likelihood of being 
awarded commission"
" 
Tracking issues
Successful tracking is fundamental to any digital marketing campaign, and especially so to affiliate marketing"
" As affiliates are paid only for performance, 
if anything goes wrong in the tracking process, it is the affiliates who suffer"
" The 
merchant will still get the desired sales, but the affiliates won’t be rewarded"
"
It is therefore good to bear in mind some of the problems that can be faced with 
tracking"
"
Multiple referrals, one sale – who gets the bounty?
With so many affiliates, it is not uncommon for a potential customer to visit a merchant’s website through the links of many different affiliates before finally 
making a purchase"
" Who do you think should receive the commission?For example: A user sees a banner on a website he visits promoting a weekend 
in Paris, booked with Eurostar"
" The user clicks on that banner and checks out 
the deals on the Eurostar website"
" A cookie is set, as the first website is an 
affiliate of Eurostar"
"
He doesn’t book right away, but after chatting to his girlfriend, they decide to 
book the trip"
" He goes to Google, searches for ‘Eurostar weekend in Paris’, and clicks on one of the PPC adverts"
" This has also been placed by an affiliate, but 
a different one"
"
This time he books the trip"
" But which affiliate should be rewarded the 
commission?
Usually the most recent referral is awarded the commission, although there are 
some merchants who also offer compensation to other affiliates involved in the sales process"
" In the example above, the affiliate who placed the PPC advert would get the commission for this sale"
"
Deleted cookies
Consumers sometimes delete cookies from their computer"
" If this happens, then the sale will never be attributed to the affiliate"
" This practice does not seem to have 
a drastic effect on numbers, however, and so most affiliates will calculate this into 
their return on investment (ROI)"
"
Clashing cookies
Merchants will often use some kind of tracking so that they can better optimise their own marketing efforts, or a merchant may make some kind of technical 
change to their website"
" It is crucial that any of these changes are tested first 
with the tracking software, to make sure that they do not create any conflict"
" It is generally accepted practice that even if a merchant’s marketing effort is responsible for the final sale, the affiliate still gets the commission if it is within 
the affiliate’s cookie period"
"
Placing an order by another method
If the customer completes the action, but does not do so online, the affiliate will not 
receive commission"
" So, if a customer visits an online retailer through an affiliate 
link, but places an order over the phone, the affiliate will miss out on commission"
"

"3 How do affiliates promote merchants?
 
Affiliates are digital marketers who are paid on a performance basis"
" Every type of 
marketing strategy will be found in the affiliate world, and affiliates can often be 
seen at the forefront of breaking technology and applying it to marketing strategies"
" Affiliate Marketing  ›  The building blocks of affiliate marketing Affiliate Marketing  ›  The building blocks of affiliate marketing
NOTE
What is the fairest 
option? This will depend 
largely on the type of 
action or product in 
question"
""
"330 331The basic aim of an affiliate is to send targeted traffic (that means customers who 
are very likely to perform the desired action) to a particular merchant’s website"
" 
Affiliates may promote as many merchants in as many industries with as many 
tactics as they want, but they usually specialise"
"
Most of the tactics will be the same as those that the merchant employs, but will 
reach a different part of the Internet population"
" Effective tracking takes care of any overlap, and will help merchants to adjust their spending for the most 
 
effective ROI"
"
The main types of affiliates can be broken up as:
• Personal websites"
" Affiliate marketing came to the fore as a way for 
personal websites to make money, although this now forms a small part of the affiliate marketing mix"
" 
• Content and niche sites"
" These are websites created specifically around a topic, and any products promoted will carry affiliate tracking"
" For example, an affiliate may create a site dedicated to digital cameras, with tips and downloads to help you get the most out of your camera"
" It could review a number of different cameras, and offer links to purchase those 
cameras online"
 All of those links will be affiliate links
" Seasonality is 
also a key time for content sites"
" Websites can be created specifically for Christmas, Mother’s Day, and many more key retail seasons"
"
• Email lists"
" Some affiliates run large opt-in email lists, and they market particular merchant offers through their email newsletters"
" Some renegade affiliates use spam email to promote merchant offers, but as affiliate marketing has matured, there are usually terms and conditions 
to prevent this in reputable industries"
"
• Loyalty sites (points, cash back or charitable donations)"
" As affiliates 
earn a percentage of a sale, some affiliates ‘split’ this with the customer 
and create cash back or points-based shopping sites"
" There are also 
some that donate a percentage of the commission to a charity"
"
• Coupon and promotions sites"
" Some affiliates use unique coupons and 
offers to get users to click on their links; this benefits the affiliate, who earns a commission, and the buyer, who gets a promo or discount"
"
• Search advertising"
 Some of the most successful affiliate marketers are those who promote various merchants through paid search engine marketing
" As these affiliates seek to find the highest earnings for the lowest CPC, this is also referred to as search arbitrage"
Affiliates will find any means possible to promote offers
" As new products and 
platforms become available, marketers and affiliate marketers find new ways to 
make them work"
" Some other examples of affiliates promoting merchants include:
• Toolbars and other browser extensions
• Social network applications
All that is required is that the clickthrough to the merchant’s website is tracked"
"
Mini case study: COUPONS
Coupon-focused affiliate marketing is very common in the digital marketing 
space"
" However, this can be perceived as cheap and untrustworthy"
 COUPONS is one website that offers this form of service
" 
The website is designed with several coupons on offer"
" Users can ‘clip’ the 
coupon, share it, like it, print it, and even tweet it"
 This website has been optimised with a strong Call to Action that entices users to take action
" The 
coupons are informative and the calculator in the top right hand corner of the 
website updates how much the user is saving"
"
Figure 3"
 The home page of Coupons
com
"
What makes this affiliate marketing programme unique is that the users 
can print the coupons"
 This form of affiliate marketing provides users and merchants with both online and offline experience
" Therefore, merchants earn returns not only when a coupon is clicked on, but also when they are printed"
"
This is an example of a website that truly has the user experience in mind, and 
makes online coupon shopping fun!

"4 Affiliate networks
 
As well as the affiliate and the merchant, there is generally a very important third 
party in the affiliate marketing mix – the affiliate network"
"
While some small affiliate programmes and some very large affiliate programmes 
(such as Amazon Associates) are run by the merchant, most merchants opt to 
use an affiliate network to provide most of the technical solutions required for an 
affiliate programme"
"
Affiliate networks publish the terms of the affiliate programme, provide tracking 
solutions, report on programmes, host creative banners, give commission payment 
options, and support both affiliates and merchants"
" 
When the affiliate logs into a network, they will see the programmes on offer and 
all the relevant metrics they need in order to decide whether the programme on offer is worth promoting"
"
Figure 4"
 Offer details from various affiliate programs
"
In this example, Hotels"
com is offering 5
5% of the commission on a sale
" The 
programme pays out $84"
74 per 100 clicks received
" The affiliate would need to 
estimate what 100 clicks will cost them and decide if managing a Hotels"
com campaign will be profitable
"
The Affiliate Network will also provide information on the programme and the 
terms and conditions, to incentivise the affiliate to join"
" 
The affiliate network will have creative assets, such as images, banners and text, 
that the affiliate can use"
Figure 5
" Links to creative assets such as images and text, provided by the affiliate"

For example, by clicking on the banner link, the affiliate can choose which image 
will best work for them"

able to create their own 
unique creative assets"
""
"334 335Affiliate networks have many affiliates and merchants signed up to them, so they 
are an ideal source for recruiting affiliates if you are a merchant, or for finding 
merchants to promote if you are an affiliate"
" To the merchants, they provide a 
one-payment solution as the merchant will be invoiced for all the commission collectively owed, which is then dispersed to the affiliates"
"
Affiliate networks usually do not charge affiliates to join"
" They can charge a 
merchant a setup fee, which will cover the cost of making sure that the tracking 
solution is successfully integrated, and can charge a monthly management fee, 
depending on the level of support offered to the merchant"
" Affiliate networks usually charge the merchant a percentage of the commission earned by the affiliate (called a commission override), so that there are incentives for the networks if they 
perform well"
" As a rough guide, this is typically 30% of the commission rewarded 
to the affiliate"
"

• Commission Junction – www"

"4 Setting up a campaign
 
Affiliate marketing forms an integral part of digital marketing – how would you go 
about setting up and launching a new campaign? Affiliate marketing should grow 
your business, and grow with your business, so it’s important to plan and prepare 
for long-lasting success"
"
First, you need a clear idea of your business’s identity, goals and unique selling 
points"
 No doubt you will have competitors that affiliates already promote; you need to be able to give affiliates compelling reasons why your programme is better
"
With this in mind, you need to determine the goal of your affiliate marketing"
" If 
you are a new business, you may just want to build traffic and brand awareness"
" 
Depending on what industry you are in, your goal could be new customer leads, or 
it could be increased retail sales"
" Make sure that you are clear on what you want, and that your website reflects this"
"
Then, you need to decide whether you are going to run your own programme, 
from affiliate recruitment to tracking and paying, or whether you are going to use an affiliate network"
" If you are using an affiliate network, you’ll need to do your homework on the best networks to join"
" Look at:
• Where your competitors are
• Who has the kind of affiliates you want
• What the joining fees and monthly fees are
• How much support they can offer you
• What countries the network is in
 
You’ll also need to decide whether you will hire an affiliate manager to run your programme, whether you will outsource your programme management, or 
whether you already have the resources to run the programme yourself"
"
You need to do a full competitor analysis, focusing on your competitors’ affiliate 
programmes"
" Look at:
• Commission tiers
• Cookie periods
• Creative offerings
• Which affiliates they work with
• Networks
• Incentives offered to affiliates
 
Prepare the basics that you’ll need to start a programme:
• Product feed
• Banners and other creative offerings
 
Using your competitor research, decide on commission, commission tiers, cookie 
period and incentives"
"
Test the tracking software on your site, and make sure that it does not conflict with 
any other tracking you are using"
"
Now, you should recruit affiliates"
" Use your competitor analysis to contact potential 
affiliates, promote your programme through affiliate forums, use your affiliate network contact channels to approach affiliates, and approach sites that you think 
fit your user demographic"
"Affiliate Marketing  ›  Setting up a campaign Affiliate Marketing  ›  The building blocks of affiliate marketing
NOTE
It’s essential for 
affiliates to choose 
campaigns that are 
relevant to the content 
they create to ensure 
they are effective, 
and to maintain their 
reputations"

" 
You need to make sure you are on top of validating sales, so that they get their

 You need to ensure that you stay competitive with your commission offering

"5 Tools of the trade
 
Affiliate marketing today forms a fundamental part of most online retailers’ 
strategies"
" So what tools does a merchant need to have a successful programme?
Any retailer should have a product feed, in either XML or CSV"
" A product feed is 
a way of providing information about the products on a merchant’s website in a 
way that breaks up the information easily, and is standardised"
" A product feed will 
probably contain the following information for each product:
• Product name
• Product URL
• Picture
• Price
• Description
• Shipping price
• Stock status: in stock / out of stock
 
Affiliates, particularly search affiliates, can then use this to promote individual products"
"
A product feed is made available on a simple URL, and displays content that 
affiliates can use in their campaigns"
" You can view a product feed by visiting: 
 
http://www"

com/category/audio/accessories/musical-instruments/pedalsand-effect-processors/pedals/n/4294563327/
"
Merchants need to create a set of banners and buttons that can be placed on 
affiliate websites"
" At a minimum, the following sizes should be available:
• 468 x 60 (banner)
• 125 x 125 (square)
• 120 x 60 (button)
• 120 x 600 (skyscraper)Having interactive banners, such as gift wizards or product searches, means that 
potential customers can interact with the brand before they even come through to 
the merchant’s website"
"
If the merchant or the affiliate network hosts the banners, these can be updated 
without the affiliates having to do anything"
 This means that the message can be kept current across all of the merchant campaigns
"
Merchants need to consider who will be monitoring and driving the success of 
the affiliate campaign"
" Merchants may be able to run the programme in-house 
with current staffing resources, or hire an affiliate manager"
" It is also possible 
to outsource the management of the affiliate programme to an agency that specialises in affiliate marketing"
"
Lastly, merchants need to keep in touch with their affiliates: the networks have 
channels for communicating with a large number of affiliates, but it is also 
worthwhile to interact on some of the affiliate marketing forums in order to keep 
informed"
"
What tools does an affiliate need?
Affiliates need to get to grips with the spectrum of digital marketing tactics, and choose what works best for them"
" Paid search affiliates will focus on PPC tactics, 
while affiliates running bespoke websites will probably put a lot of energy into SEO"
" 
It depends on where their talent lies, and where they see a gap in the market"
"
For affiliates, keeping up to date with merchants, other affiliates and the industry 
is probably the key to growth"
" That, and finding the time to put it all into practice! Joining forums and keeping tabs on industry leaders will help to do just that"

affiliate"
" Similarly, merchants may decide to terminate a programme, 
meaning a loss of revenue for affiliates"
" Particularly if little notice is 
given, affiliates may have spent time and money setting up promotions, only to have the campaign pulled out from underneath them"
" 
• There is still little to no industry regulation, although the majority of the 
industry does strive towards best practices"
" While some affiliates have 
resorted to shady practices in the past (with adware and email spam), 
the majority have banded together to blacklist this kind of behaviour"
"
• Some merchants fear a loss of brand control"
"
• Affiliate programmes are not easily scalable, since they often include a 
lot of admin and technical setup"
"
But, of course, there are so many benefits to affiliate marketing:
• It’s pay-for-performance marketing, so merchants are paying only for 
growth"

• The merchant’s sales force just became bigger, as well as its branding 
potential"

"1 One-line summary
 
An ebook retailer turns to affiliate marketing and dramatically exceeds its traffic and sales targets"
"

"2 The problem
 
The eCommerce market is highly competitive, and online shoppers tend to compare prices and look for the best deals, rather than staying loyal to a specific retailer"
" Because of this, retailers 
need to keep their prices low, leading to reduced margins and race to the lowest price"
"
Customer acquisition is therefore a priority for eCommerce retailers, and they often turn to a wide 
range of online marketing channels to find and attract new markets"
" The Search Agency worked 
with a well-known ebook retailer – which offers over 3 million products in 170 countries – to get 
their flagging in-house affiliate programme to deliver real results"

"3 The solution
 
The Search Agency analysed the way in which the ebook retailer was running its affiliate 
programme and developed a solution that it called the ‘Affiliate Triple A strategy’"
" It was structured 
in the following way:
• Affiliate Acquisition focused on finding and retaining a high number of quality affiliate 
partners"
 This involved creating a marketing campaign and recruitment programme aimed at these affiliates
"
• Affiliate Activation involved creating special offers and deals to encourage affiliates to get on board"
" This included creating a basic informational guide to the programme and 
benefits, and contacting previous affiliates who had since stopped sharing the retailer’s 
links"
"
• Affiliate Activity wrapped this up by encouraging sales and getting affiliates more deeply engaged in the programme"
" They created a merchandising calendar, banner ads, copy, and a product feed to inform and support the affiliates on the programme"
"

"4 The results
 
Through proper planning, engagement and incentives, The Search Agency managed to smash the ebook retailer’s target of 100% more sales over 12 months"
" Their actual results over were:
• A 200% increase in traffic generated by affiliates in 12 months
• A 321% increase in sales transactions generated from affiliate sources in 12 months
• Over 18 months, the affiliate-based sales transactions increased by 629%"

As affiliates are marketing in an online environment, they will use all of the tactics in this book"
" Some affiliates even run affiliate marketing campaigns for their own websites! 
But as a merchant, how does affiliate marketing fit into the overall marketing mix?For starters, affiliate marketing can allow merchants to add elements to their digital marketing 
with a fixed CPA"
" As an example, a merchant may want to promote their products through search 
advertising, but may lack the expertise to run a campaign"
" Instead of paying an agency, the 
merchant can recruit search affiliates to run search advertising, and the merchant will only ever pay for performance"
Affiliate Marketing  ›  The bigger picture Affiliate Marketing  ›  Advantages and challenges
"340 341Working closely with affiliates, merchants can get many more case studies for analysing and

" As affiliates are paid for 
performance, they will be more than willing to advise on ways to improve conversion rates"

"9 Summary
 
Affiliate marketing is performance-based marketing where merchants reward affiliates commission for successful referrals"
"
There are different types of commission, based on the merchant’s industry:
• CPL
• CPA
• Revenue share
• CPC
The most essential element in affiliate marketing is tracking"
" Tracking software places a cookie on 
a user’s browser when that user clicks on an affiliate link"
 The cookie period is determined by the merchant
" If the user performs the desired action within the cookie period, the affiliate is awarded 
commission"
"
Affiliate networks are often used as an intermediary between affiliates and merchants"
" Affiliate 
networks provide tracking solutions, reporting and support to both affiliates and merchants"
"
Affiliates use a number of means to promote merchants"
" These include:
• Personal websites
• Content and niche sites
• Email lists
• Loyalty sites (points or cash back or charitable donations)
• Coupon and promotions sites
• Search advertising and search arbitrage
One of the keys to successful affiliate marketing is ongoing communication between merchants 
and affiliates"

That content can be anything, from images to text, and of course, video"
" Text content can be read by search engines, but content such as images and video

Videos can come from anyone, and from anywhere"
" Small home videos can 
experience massive global reach, as was the case with the popular Charlie Bit My Finger video which has accumulated 558 million views as of September 2013"
" Musicians often use social video platforms to share their music videos and, of 
course, brands use video-sharing platforms to communicate messages via video"
" 
People are increasingly interacting with brands via video by creating opinion videos, parodies and responses"
" More importantly, they have the power to market 
themselves, their ideas, who they are and what they do"

"3 Video content strategy 
 
Videos are powerful because they can have a strong emotional effect on viewers – 
it’s no secret that funny, shocking, amazing and inspirational videos do particularly 
well online"
" Video is the ideal tool for experiential marketing – giving viewers the 
chance to experience something alongside the onscreen actors and consider how they would feel or act in that situation"
" It also helps to show off a brand’s personality, tone and communication style"
"
Many people are still under the misconception that online videos are expensive 
and difficult to produce"
" That’s not the case – the many millions of successful 
home video bloggers (vloggers) and marketers prove otherwise"
" 
Unlike content made for TV, web video content can be filmed at a much lower cost 
and quality, using readily available home video equipment"
 Affordable high-quality cameras have made quality content production a reality for everyone
" Viewers 
don’t necessarily expect a super-slick offering (though even this is possible with 
some basic video editing software)"
" To get started with making video marketing content, you will need:
• A camera – depending on what you can afford, this can range from a simple webcam or your mobile phone’s camera to a (top-of-the-line) 
professional camera, though there are many excellent mid-range options 
available at a low price"
"
• A microphone – while some cameras have a built-in microphone, it’s worthwhile investing in a proper mic to ensure that you capture better sound quality (built-in microphones tend to catch a lot of background 
noise at the expense of the main audio)"
"
• Video editing software – you will need a software package to cut, edit and finish your video; there is a wide range of options, including free built-in 
software (Movie Maker for Windows and iMovie for Mac) and professional video editing suites (such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe AfterEffects), which 
can be more costly"
 YouTube also offers an online video editing tool

"1 Video content versus video ads
 
Video marketing covers two approaches:
1"
" Video content: These are videos made to entertain, inform, share updates 
or otherwise enlighten or delight the viewer"
" Much like syndicated articles 
or blog posts, these are usually not directly promotional, but instead 
provide shareable content that gives value to the viewer"
" Some examples of video content include:
•  How-to guides and tutorials •  Conference talks
•  Video presentations •  Valuable industry updates
•  Educational lectures •  Product reviews and advice
•  Entertainment
2"
" Video ads: These are simply adverts that are filmed and formatted for 
online use"
" These can be existing TV commercials that are shared online, 
or custom ads made specifically for the web"
" We’ll cover a range of options 
for posting your video ads below, in the section on paid video promotion"

"2 Going viral
 
The holy grail of video marketing (and, in fact, any marketing on the web) is having 
a piece of content ‘go viral’"
" This means that the content spreads from person to 
person through the web at a very high rate, attracting an exponentially growing 
audience as it gains popularity"
" The key to this viral effect is social media, where each user is connected to a wide network of others and can easily share content with their friends"
" Because this is a trusted social referral, it’s more likely that they will view and share it themselves (if it’s good enough)"
"

"348 349Nobody quite knows the secret recipe for getting content to go viral, and quite 
possibly there isn’t one – the sheer variety and scope of viral videos shows that 
almost anything might catch the interest of the Internet on the right day"
" This 
means that it’s very difficult to craft a video in order to make it go viral"
" But there are some principles that can help you make great video content with the potential for viral spread:
•	 Address a currently trending topic"
" Find something that people are 
already excited about or interested in, and see how you can contribute 
meaningfully to the conversation"
" For example, make your own edited version of a viral video"
"
•	 Make it enticing"
" Craft the video’s description, title and thumbnail so that they draw attention"
" 
•	 Make it remarkable"
" Whether it’s funny, astonishing, scary, shocking or informational, your content has to have value for your viewers – and it 
has to give them social capital for spreading them"
"
•	 Make it unique"
" The Internet loves new, fresh, crazy ideas – so don’t rehash somebody else’s success or stick to a formula"
" Be truly creative 
and inventive"
"
•	 Make it shareable"
" Include the tools and incentives to make your video easy to share; consider social media chiclets, annotations, encouraging comments and more"
" 
•	 Make it short"
" With very few exceptions, successful viral videos tend to be short, impactful clips"
" People have short attention spans, so make 
sure you get the message across quickly"

"4 Video production step by step
 
Creating video content for the web is easy and cost effective"
" Consider the following 
process"
"
13"
4
"1 Identifying your audience
 
As always, you first need to identify the audience for whom you are creating this 
video content"
" What are their wants and needs? What video content are they already 
consuming? How can you engage their attention, provide something valuable, and promote your brand at the same time? 
Some solid market research will reveal the answers to these questions"
13
4
"2 Planning and concept
 
Now you need to come up with the core concept for the video, which will be dictated 
by what will resonate with your target audience"
" Will it be a once-off clip or part of 
an ongoing series? What marketing message do you hope to convey? Decide on the 
best style and tone in which to convey this"
"
Once you have decided these aspects, it’s time to start planning your actual video 
shoot"
" You will need to write a script (or at least prepare a breakdown of what the video should include), and schedule the shoot – consider the venue, crew required, actors, and any other props or elements you need"
" How long this takes will depend 
on the complexity of the video you’re planning"
"
13"
4
"3 Producing the video
 
Now it’s time to get filming! Once you have all the footage and audio, you will need 
to edit it together, add any special effects and other elements, and save it as the 
final video"
" 
13"
4
"4 Choosing and uploading to platform
 
Once you have the video, you need to decide where it will be uploaded to"
"
There are two options for making your video content available online"
" These are not 
mutually exclusive and there are techniques for both to ensure the best distribution and search coverage for your video"
" For example, you could be embedding videos 
posted elsewhere on your site"
"
Online video can be hosted on your own site, or it can be posted to one or many 
video distribution channels"
" If you post your video somewhere such as YouTube or Vimeo, it is then easy to embed it into your website as well"
"
The main advantage of posting a video to a third-party site is the opportunity to 
exploit an already existing audience quickly"
" These websites also usually have a 
built-in social and viral media aspect to their user experience"
" Video-sharing sites 
tend to have simplified algorithms which are easier to take advantage of, leading to more rapid universal search exposure"
"
YouTube (www"
youtube
"com) should be your first port of call when posting videos, 
since it is the biggest and most popular video hosting site on the web"
" Rather than posting a video under a normal username, create a branded channel – a YouTube 
‘home page’ for videos created by your brand"
" NOTE
For some helpful 
pointers and advice on producing your video, take a look at the Vimeo Video School: vimeo"

Video Marketing  ›  Video production step by step Video Marketing  ›  Video content strategy
"350 351YouTube channels allow you to add a logo, background, branded elements, a brand 
description and links to your other web properties"
" This means you can customise 
the page as you see fit"
" Channels also have a range of analytical features for 
measuring video engagement, and as an added bonus, they work well on mobile devices, too"
" Furthermore, you gain many benefits in ranking well on the world’s most popular search engine – Google"
"

"Other good options for video hosting include:
• Vimeo (www"
vimeo
"com)
• MetaCafe (www"

• Dailymotion (www"

"com) 
If your video is hosted on your own website, the obvious advantage is that you have 
control over the whole website and environment in which it is hosted, from the look and feel to on-page text, meta data and user experience"
" When it comes to advertising and related content, you control both, and you decide how to monetise 
it"
" Traffic and links go directly to your website, and can therefore be integral to a 
longer-term search strategy"
" However, consider embedding your videos from your account on your chosen video-sharing site"
" Not only does this allow you to cross-
pollinate content, but you will also gain more views via more points of entry"
"
13"

"5 Optimising
 
At this point, you need to optimise your video for easy discovery on the web"
"
Most searching on the web is keyword based: you type keywords relevant to your 
query into a search box, and the results of the search should list content that matches your keywords"
" Whether you are using a search box on a website, on 
YouTube, or Google, this outlines the very basic way in which we expect the search 
function to work"
"
The search engine tries to match your keywords to the content it has indexed, 
and is also trying to determine how to rank the results so that you get the most relevant content at the top of your search results page"
"
This is all covered in great detail in the Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) chapter"
" 
Optimising video for search involves understanding the basics of SEO, and then the 
particular challenges and tactics of optimising video content"
"
Search engines rely on being able to use text in the content to determine what it 
is about, and other indicators to determine how relevant that content is"
" When it comes to web pages, search engines can ‘read’ the text on the page to determine what the page is about, and can measure the links coming in to determine how 
relevant the page is"
" When it comes to video, the search engine cannot ‘watch’ or 
‘read’ the video in the same way that a human can (though there are technological solutions that are starting to make this possible)"
" Instead, it must rely on other text 
on the page, as well as the meta data added, to determine what the video is about"
" 
The search engine also needs to look for ways to measure relevance"
"

""
"352 353Marketers and website owners now need to optimise all their various forms of 
content – be they text pages, images or videos – in order to achieve better rankings"
"  
Video search engine optimisation (VSEO) involves the use of basic SEO foundations 
and additional creative optimisation methods to ensure that online video content appears higher up on the SERPs"
"
Figure 3"
" A search for the words “dog waits patiently for treats” brings up website 
and video results"
"
Optimising video for video-sharing sites such as YouTube means that you will 
appear not only in search results on the video-sharing site, but also on SERPs such 
as Google"
" While each video-sharing site will use its own algorithm, the guidelines 
below can be considered best practice across most of the video-sharing sites"
"
 
1"
 Video title is very important
"
Video title is one of the first things a user sees when clicking through to a video, and is used first and foremost by the video search engines to determine the relevance 
of your video to the search query"
" Your most important keywords should appear in 
the first three words of the title"
" Longer, descriptive titles are better than short, concise and obscure ones"
"
Figure 4"
 Video title
"
2"
" Use informative, long descriptions"
" 
Descriptions will contain key terms that search engines should be looking for to 
determine what the video is about"
" Use your most important keywords here! You 
can include as much information as possible, but put the most important stuff in 
the first 25 characters"
" You can include a link in your description, enabling you to direct users to other content that you have"

"

 Use the tags to input several keywords
"
Put your most important keywords first"
 You can also capitalise on popular search terms and piggyback on popular or topical phrases
" YouTube will use your tags 
to help categorise your video"
  Ensure that these are relevant to your video
" and 
utilise terms from the same category"
"

"
YouTube Suggest and Google Suggest are useful tools for generating ideas"
"
4"
" Encourage comments, subscriptions, ratings, embedding and sharing"
" 
Get people to engage with your video in any way you can, and don’t forget to respond 
to relevant comments – it’s critical that your budding community feels that they 
matter and that you are taking them seriously"
" This is a key point to remember if 
you want to create a thriving community"
" Engagement is a massive factor in search engine rankings, so it is very important to focus on content – strong optimisation is no substitute for weak content"
"
To incite discussion, consider posting a comment as soon as you have uploaded a 
video, or adding an annotation to encourage feedback"
"  Pose a provocative question 
to spark discussion and lead the conversation – the absolute key to success in the social media space is engagement"

 Optimise the thumbnail
" 
Consider adding an enticing thumbnail frame"
"  YouTube allows you to choose any 
moment in the video to be the thumbnail"
" Simply optimising the thumbnail image 
can encourage increased clickthroughs and views, which helps to increase search 
visibility"
"
Figure 8"

"

" Use annotations 
Use annotations to link to and from other video properties"
"  Annotations allow you to 
add text boxes with clickable URLs (which are crawled by the search engine spiders 
as well) at points of your choosing in your video"
"  Annotations in already popular 
and current videos can be used to drive traffic to new videos, although it should be standard practice to include them in a video as soon as it has been uploaded"
 It’s also a great way to encourage viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel
"
The nature of YouTube is such that the number of views for pages on which videos 
are watched is always higher than channel views"
" However, if a paid search 
campaign is being run, the option to play clicked videos on the channel page exists"
" This is optimal as it could boost interactions with the branded channel header image, increase engagement with the playlist, and raise the channel view stats"
"
7"
" Upload videos regularly
Upload videos regularly to ensure continuous channel activity and topical interest"
" Consider the nature of the brand and what you are trying to communicate to your 
viewers; you must decide how often videos are uploaded"
" But remember, the more 
videos you upload, the higher your channel will rank as a result of Google picking 
up on your fresh content"
" Think of it like a TV schedule – let people know when your 
‘show’ is on so they know when to come back"
"
The amount of content you upload is also dependent on the service or product your 
brand offers, and your video budget"
 It’s a careful balance of not overloading your channel with useless media and keeping content fresh and engaging

"6 Promoting

" There are three ways you can promote your video – using owned, earned and paid media channels"

"7 Engaging the community
 
As we mentioned earlier, it’s essential that you engage with your community to keep them coming back for more"
" Respond in a timely manner to any comments or questions, and take feedback on your content into account when planning new 
videos"
" The audience won’t stay hooked for long – after all, there are millions of 
new videos being added every day – so ensure that you engage with them to create a sense of community, the ability to relate to them, and genuine interest"
"

"8 Reporting
 
As with all digital marketing tactics, in video marketing it’s essential to track and analyse data about your activities, and then optimise your strategy accordingly"
" 
When creating video content, use the various measurement options available to 
determine what you can do better going forward"
"
YouTube Analytics is a free tool that enables anyone with a YouTube account to view 
detailed statistics about the videos they upload to the site"
" You can see how often videos are viewed in different geographic regions, as well as how popular they are relative to all videos in that market over a given period of time"
"

Video Marketing  ›  Video production step by step Video Marketing  ›  Video production step by step
NOTE
A great way to use 
annotations is to link 
to some of your other 
videos at the end - this 
works similarly to 
“articles you may like” 
at the end of a blog post"
""
"356 357You can also delve deeper into the lifecycle of videos, such as how long it takes for 
a video to become popular, and what happens to video views as popularity peaks"
" 
YouTube even breaks down the specific seconds when people stop watching the 
video"
"
Using these metrics, you can increase your videos’ view counts and improve 
popularity on the site"
" For example, you might learn that your videos are most popular on Wednesdays, that they have a huge following in Spain, or that new 
videos that play off previous content become more popular more quickly"
" If you 
see people dropping off halfway into the video, add an annotation to mix things up"
 There are many creative ways to approach this
" 
With this information, you can concentrate on posting compelling, fresh content 
that appeals to selected target audiences, and post these videos on days when you 
know these viewers are on the site"
" You could even go a step further and customise 
the video, dubbing it in Spanish (closed captions also support SEO efforts)"
 The range of possibilities to customise – and optimise – your content is limited only by the brand’s level of willingness
"  
Furthermore, you can access a breakdown of how viewers discovered a specific 
video, which can then be used to optimise the keywords, tags and descriptions of videos"

"5 Video promotion
There are four main ways in which users find content and video online:
• A user knows what sort of video they are looking for and goes directly to a search engine to search for content"
" This relies on SEO (or search advertising, if you decide to promote the content on Google)"
"
• A user follows recommendations from others, found through emailed links, 
social bookmarking and sharing services, or social media such as blogs, 
Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube"
 This relies on social sharing
"
• Someone knows exactly what they are looking for and navigates to the appropriate URL directly"
 This relies on good branding and market awareness
"
• The user finds the video through paid advertisements and promotions"
 This relies on paid advertising
"
13"
5
"1 Earned video promotion
 
We covered the general guidelines for optimising your video for search earlier in this chapter"
" Here are some specific considerations for YouTube search 
optimisation, as well as social sharing"
"YouTube video search optimisation 
YouTube, which is owned by Google, is the dominant player in the video-sharing 
market"
" While we focus in this section on optimising for YouTube in particular, 
many of the same approaches apply to other video-sharing sites"
" 
Once you’ve determined how users are already accessing your videos and where 
they appear in SERPs, you can use various techniques to improve your rankings"
" 
While YouTube, like Google, keeps its search algorithms a closely guarded trade 
secret, digital marketers can speculate and experiment to see what works (and what doesn’t)"
" 
Firstly, the following components are evaluated on a keyword and key phrase level 
by the search engine spiders:
• Titles
• Descriptions
• Tags
• Playlist additions
• Inbound links
 
Additionally, YouTube defines relevance in accordance with the popularity of a 
given video as well as the interaction taking place around it"
" The following factors 
play a dominant role in the algorithm:
• Video views
• Channel views
• Ratings
• Comments
• Shares
• Embeds
• Subscribers
• Age of video
 
Keeping YouTube content current and entertaining is vital if a video is very new"
" 
This will allow the video to engage with viewers"
" Remember, a new video growing 
in popularity (that is, views), will take preference in the SERP over an older video 
with more views"
"
Social sharing
You should initiate and encourage social sharing – ask your viewers to post your video on social networks, aggregators, social bookmarking sites and other 
channels"
" The more people share, the wider an audience you can potentially 
reach – and the more likely your video is to go viral (or, at least, spread far and wide)"
 Social sharing and recommendations are also increasingly relevant ranking factors for search engines

"2 Paid video promotion
 
In the same way as with Google’s search advertising, you can pay to have your 
video recommended on YouTube"
" You are able to bid on searches or popular videos, 
show pre-rolls on other videos, and have your video content displayed alongside 
the search results of other videos"
" 
Paid promotions on YouTube are a cost-effective and quick way to promote video 
content, especially if the content is topical"
 It’s targeted and controlled
" For InStream, you pay only when a user watches 30 seconds or more of your video, or, if your video is shorter than 30 seconds, you’ll pay only if they finish watching 
the entire clip"
" For InSearch and InDisplay, you pay per click on your video"
" This 
is a great opportunity for brand awareness, coupled with a potentially lower cost"
" 
However, some users find this form of advertising highly intrusive, particularly in 
markets where bandwidth is slow and expensive, and it may take several seconds for the ad to load before it can be skipped"
 Some ad blockers block YouTube advertising
"
YouTube offers a wide variety of video ad types:
• TrueView In-Search: These video ads appear to the right of the search 
results on the YouTube search pages"
" These ads are triggered by 
keywords, so it’s important to know what users are searching for and 
ensure your ads contain the right keywords"
" 
• TrueView In-Display: These ads appear to the right of the YouTube video 
the user is currently watching"
" 
• TrueView In-Stream: These ads appear at the start of regular YouTube videos"
 Viewers have the option of skipping these ads after five seconds

"3 Owned video promotion
 
If you are hosting your video content yourself, you can and should still optimise the content around it for best search opportunities"
" As with posted video, it’s the text 
content on the page with the video that is so important"
"
Make sure that your page title is descriptive, as well as the video title and the video 
file name"
" The text on the page with the video is important, so optimise it to reflect 
the content of the video"
"
You can also use speech-to-text software such as Blinkx or Spinvox to transcribe 
the video"
 The text can then be used in the video meta data
"
Use social media sharing chiclets to make it easy for visitors to share the video on 
their social networks, aggregators and blogs"
" If you have a Facebook page, post it there"
" If you have a Twitter account – tweet about it!
And don’t forget to drive website visitors to your video content – put a link or strong 
Call to Action on your home page or main landing pages, to encourage visitors to 
view and engage with your videos"
"

"6 Tools of the trade
 
When it comes to video content, there is a wide range of tools at your disposal"

"7 Advantages and challenges
 
Posting regular video content shouldn’t result in any negativity, provided it is done 
in a focused, engaging way"
" Videos are great for engaging viewers and growing 
your social media community"
" 
By studying analytics, platform insights and comments, you can see which videos 
on your channel are providing users with what they’re looking for"
" You can then 
choose to advertise your best videos with the various formats YouTube and Google have on offer"
"
The number of views you get is an important factor in getting ranked or featured 
on YouTube and, by pushing your best content through the paid medium, you can 
get the ball rolling and significantly increase your chances of picking up organic 
traction (both within YouTube and Google’s universal SERPs)"

Starting out with video production can be a bit challenging as you learn the ropes 
of what makes a viewable, entertaining video"
 It can also be difficult to come up with constantly new and interesting ideas – but this will become easier with time

Producing great video content
The team made sure that their video content followed best-practice principles and provided lots

"4 The results
The video marketing campaign achieved solid results and met all the intended goals"
" Throughout 
the process, the video content and campaigns were optimised with weekly insights, which were 
gathered from AdWords for video, YouTube Analytics and Google Analytics"
"
The aim was to get a view rate of at least 10% and a cost per view of under $0"
20
" The most cost-
effective engagement and awareness driver was AdWords for Video"
" Between 20 March and 31 
July 2012, it generated: 
• Over 18"
"2 million impressions
• Over 109 000 views
• 17 332 clicks
• A cost per view (CPV) of $0"
16
"  
Overall, the video content was well utilised to meet the brand goals, maximised reach and engagement of the video assets on relevant cost-effective platforms"
" Finally, it met the overarching  
goal of facilitating brand association with MasterChef South Africa and Woolworths"
" 
13"
"9 The bigger picture
 
Video marketing can form the cornerstone of a great content marketing strategy, linking closely 
with the other content that you create to engage and provide value to your customers"
" 
Videos can also be added to marketing messages such as email newsletters to improve 
engagement"
"
Because search engines serve a range of media types on their results pages, video content plays 
an important role in search engine optimisation"
" Not only can optimising videos for search increase 
your search engine ranking, but data show that it increases clickthrough rate from the search engine results pages, and that these visits are longer and more engaged than other search visits"
"
Social media provide a great tool for spreading your video, and video content can be a strong driver 
for people to join your social media platforms"
 Make sure that you provide great value

"10 Summary
 
Video has become an integral part of the online world"
" The potential for exposure – as well as interaction – is massive, and brands that fail to capitalise on this risk being left behind as 
competitors build thriving communities"
" 
As with most content, it is up to the brand to decide how to represent its video content"
" Videos 
can be hosted on popular video-sharing websites to capitalise on already existing audiences and 
developed interfaces, or on bespoke websites that allow for free reign in customisation"
" 
Brands should then aim to optimise their videos on the chosen platforms to increase their visibility 
on search engines"
" 
Creating a healthy community is also important in increasing exposure"
" Very rarely, if ever, does 
an audience come to video content without input from the creators"
" On top of optimising for search 
and other tweaks, brands should upload content regularly or risk losing any ground gained"
" 
Social media should also be considered as its platforms allow for the sharing of content, as well 
as commentary"
" 
Overall, brands should be aware that there is no quick fix for video"
" It requires planning and 
investment as well as long-term commitment to creating brand advocates"

"1 Introduction
In many ways, social media epitomises what the web is about: collaborating and 
sharing content, ideas and information"
" Social media is behind the explosion of 
content on the Internet, as various channels have allowed anyone with an Internet 
connection to create and share content easily and for free"
" Because social media has so many participants, it is also very dynamic"
" In fact, this is the chapter that is most likely to be out of date the second this book has gone to print"
"
Simply put, social media are media (from written to visual to audio) that are 
designed to be shared"
" Sharing means that it easy to comment on, send and copy 
the media, and that there are no high costs associated with this"
" And, because of the connected nature of the Internet, it means that sharing, commenting and viewing can all be tracked and measured"
"
Social media are also referred to as Web 2"
"0, consumer-generated media, citizen 
media and new media"
" In fact, comparing social media to traditional media is 
probably the most useful way of defining what exactly this means"
"
Traditional Media Social Media
Fixed, unchangeable Instantly updateable
Commentary limited and not real-time Unlimited real-time commentary
Limited, time-delayed bestseller lists Instant popularity gauge

The Internet, and the software developed to run on it, has made it simple for anyone to publish and distribute media"
" It has also made it simple for anyone to 
access the content that has been published"
"
The realm of social media is about collaborating, creating content, sharing and, 
most of all, connecting"
"
This chapter focuses on the various social media channels, while the next chapter 
looks at how to use those channels strategically"
"In this chapter, you will learn:
• The four main social media channels – social networking, content sharing, bookmarking and aggregating, and location-based media
• A wide variety of platforms that fall under these four channels
• How to track and measure your social media marketing success
• The best ways to engage with audiences on social media

"3 Social media channels
 
Social media has changed the world of marketing"
" Social media is all about the 
ways in which we create, connect and share content online, and can be used as an 
integral part of an online marketing campaign"
"
To keep up with their audiences, traditional media have had to adapt"
" This has 
changed the way in which they publish, both online and offline, as well as how they can sell advertising"
"
For example, many newspapers now publish their content online as well as in their 
print publications"
" Online, they can get instant commentary on their articles"
" This 
snapshot of what their readers think can then be used to make editorial decisions"
" 
Print stories can be supplemented online with video, and this has been embraced by many news organisations"
 Visit www
bbc
co
"uk/news/video_and_audio to see 
how one newspaper is using video online"
" News also comes from citizen journalists 
– people on the ground who post instant updates to social media about events unfolding around them"
"
The following chapter addresses the strategic use of social media to achieve 
a variety of outcomes"
 Here we look at the various social media channels
" 
Categorising social media into channels is challenging, but it is a useful way to 
compare them"
" 
And not all platforms fall neatly into one channel – for example, Twitter is part 
microblog, part social network, part aggregator, and even includes some location-based elements"
" We’ve categorised the platforms below according to their dominant properties, but always keep in mind that these aren’t exclusive and may 
change as social channels adapt to meet their users’ growing requirements"
"Social media channels can be categorised as:
• Social networks: social channels that are built around social profiles"
"
• Content creation: using social channels to create and share content"
"
• Bookmarking and aggregating: social curation and sharing content"
"
• Location: a subset of social networks that are based on location"
"

"4 Social networking 
 
Social networking refers to forming and maintaining online social networks for 
communities"
" The communities are people who share real-world connections, 
interests and activities, or are interested in exploring the interests and activities 
of others"
 And to complete the definition: building these social networks requires the use of software
"
Social networking is all about using the tools of the Internet to connect and 
build relationships with others"
" Social networking sites such as Facebook 
 
(www"
facebook
"com), MySpace (www"
myspace
com) and LinkedIn (www
linkedin
"com) 
allow users to create personal profiles and then interact with their connections by 
sharing media, sending messages and blogging"
" Not only do social networking 
sites allow you to interact with the members of your own virtual Rolodex, but they also allow you to extend beyond your personal network"
" In addition, organisations – anything from businesses to bands and charities – can also create and maintain 
profiles on many of these networks"
"

Social Media Channels  ›  Social networking Social Media Channels  ›  Key terms and concepts
NOTE
These are broad groups, 
not absolute categories"
" 
One platform could have 
the characterisitics of several channels, for example"
""
"370 371Social networks have created new meaning for the term ‘friend’, with many 
connections existing solely online"
" In the realm of social networking, it is 
unnecessary to have met someone in order to connect with them"
"
Personal profile pages remove much of the anonymity of the Internet"
" Users of 
social networks reveal a great deal of information about themselves, from basic 
demographics such as age, gender and location, to nuanced and detailed lists of likes and dislikes"
" They are also divulging this information to the networks, and 
hence to the networks’ advertisers to allow more relevant targeting"
" Users tend 
not to be aware of the data that is amassing in their online profile, and this can lead to privacy risks and concerns"
"
Social networks can be general, such as Facebook, or niche, such as LinkedIn 
or Dopplr (www"
dopplr
com)
 LinkedIn is a network for business professionals
" 
Members connect to people they know professionally and are able to recommend 
members they have worked with"
 Dopplr is a social network for frequent travellers
" Members can share their trips, and make plans to meet up when schedules overlap"
"
There are social networking platforms that allow anyone to build their own social 
network using the underlying technology of the platform"
 One example of this is Ning (www

"1 Facebook 
 
Facebook has become the most dominant personal social network in the world"
" According to official figures, over 1 billion people are now registered on the 
platform – that’s one in every seven humans on earth – and more than half of them 
are active on Facebook every day (Facebook, 2013)"
" Because people are spending so much time on Facebook, advertisers and marketers naturally want to capitalise on this audience"
"
Over the past few years, Facebook has launched a number of ways for brands and 
organisations to use the social network to connect with potential customers"
" 
Pages  
A Page is profile for a brand, organisation or celebrity"
" It looks very similar to a 
personal profile, and in the same way in which two people can add each other as 
friends on Facebook, people can choose to connect with a brand on Facebook by 
liking its Page"

you surprised by what 
you see?"
"372 373Each Page consists of the following elements: 
• A cover image (the large banner at the top)
• A profile image that represents the brand 
• Some ‘About’ information that can include links and more detailed 
information 
• The ‘Wall’, where the brand’s posts and interactions are displayed in a chronological timeline
 
Tabs are distinct pages of information on the brand’s Page"
" Tabs can be used to 
house richer, more graphic content"
" Information in the tabs can be served through 
an application or through an iFrame, allowing for interactions within them"

Facebook Connect
Facebook Connect allows users to log into services external to Facebook using their Facebook login details"

have logged in to"
" This can make it easier for users to log in to new services 
without having to create new usernames and passwords"
" They can also easily see who else in their social circle is using that service, and share information back to their social circle"

"374 375Like button
The Facebook Like button allows users to indicate that they like or recommend 
content, images, media or websites, and to share that recommendation with their 
social circle"
" The Like button can be used by any website, allowing visitors to 
recommend their site and content easily, and to see who of their friends might like the same content"
"
News feed
The news feed is the stream of content that users see when they log in to Facebook"
" It’s a selection of recent posts and updates from their friends, and from the brands 
with which they have connected on Facebook"
" Facebook uses an algorithm, based 
on relevance to the user, to determine what information to show in their news feed"
"
This algorithm is called the News Feed Algorithm, and is a more sophisticated 
version of the original algorithm, which was called EdgeRank"
" According to an official Facebook update, the following factors are considered by the algorithm 
before it displays content in a user’s news feed:
• Is this timely and relevant content?
• Is this content from a source you would trust?
• Would you share it with friends or recommend it to others?
• Is the content genuinely interesting to you or is it trying to game News 
Feed distribution? (e"
g
", asking for people to like the content)
• Would you call this a low quality post or meme?
• Would you complain about seeing this content in your News Feed?
(Facebook, 2013)
Brands want their Page posts, stories and comments to appear in a user’s news 
feed"
" The user is more likely to interact with content in the news feed, or to follow 
through to the page, than if there were nothing to prompt them"
" It is therefore vital 
to ensure that your page content takes this algorithm into consideration"
"

"2 Google+
 
Google+ is Google’s answer to social networking giant Facebook, and is slowly but surely being integrated into all of Google’s products"
" 
Google+ provides seamless ways to interact through Circles, Hangouts, Local 
information and more"
"• Circles allows users to create customised groups (friends, family, classmates, and so on) and target their sharing to just the right people"
" By 
using Circles, users are able to limit sharing by breaking up their network 
into distinct clusters of contacts"
" 
• Real-time communication is available through Hangouts, where users enter video chat rooms and let others know that they’re interested in chatting"
" If users are already chatting within a circle, other circle 
members will be notified and can join in"
" 
• Google+ Local integrates user data based on the person’s location, and shares information about nearby businesses, events, places and user 
reviews pertaining to where the user is"

"3 Social networking as a marketing tool
 
Social networks, which are usually free for their members, tend to rely on advertising for their revenue"
" Because demographic and psychographic 
information is collected by the social networks, advertisers are able to target their 
adverts to a very specific audience segment"
"
Most social networks offer opportunities for brands to create a presence on the 
social network, and to make use of the existing social network to connect with and reach out to customers"
"

"5 Content creation 
 
YouTube may be the first content-sharing site that comes to mind, but users share images, audio and other media, too"
" If it can be created, it can be shared"
" There 
are many sites that make it easy to share videos, images and audio, and they are 
exceptionally popular"
" From Instagram to YouTube, they have all tapped into the fact that we love to create content for others to view"
"
The key word here is free: there are no fees for joining, whether you are uploading 
or viewing content (although premium paid-for memberships can provide added 
features)"
 This means that these sites attract an enormous audience
" In fact, 
according to Alexa rankings, YouTube is the third largest website in the world (Alexa, 2013)!
Many of these services also encourage distribution of their content"
" YouTube 
allows videos to be embedded easily into other websites, and Flickr has generated 
a number of applications and widgets that allow the images to be shown all over 
the web (and even printed onto cards and stickers via www"

"2 Video sharing
 
Online video consumption continues to grow year on year as bandwidth gets faster 
and cheaper"
 Sharing video content is easy with social video sites such as YouTube
" 
Anyone can upload videos captured on simple devices such as webcams and 
mobile phones, or on high-end professional cameras"
"
There are several video-sharing platforms"
" Some of the most popular include 
YouTube (www"
youtube
"com), Vimeo (www"
vimeo
"com), Instagram Video (instagram"
com) and Vine (vine
co)
" 
On YouTube, which is owned by Google, users upload 100 hours’ worth of video every minute, and 4 billion hours of video are watched every month (YouTube, 
2013)"
 This makes it the premier social video-sharing site on the web
" Most video 
consumption is based on social media – the top videos have succeeded because they have been spread virally over vast social networks – and over one billion 
unique users visit YouTube every month (YouTube, 2013)"
" 
YouTube offers many features to video uploaders and viewers, and is simple to use"
" 
While it is possible for unregistered users to watch most of the publicly available 
videos, a quick, straightforward registration process allows members to upload 
an unlimited number of clips, comment on and add video responses to them,

YouTube and marketing
There are two aspects to marketing through YouTube: promoting video content 
through YouTube, and advertising next to (or during) content on YouTube"
"
Figure 7"
 Content promotion through YouTube can be a powerful tool
"
YouTube offers Brand Channels"
" Brands can sign up for and customise their 
own channels on YouTube, adding backgrounds, logos, playlists and additional 
community features"
" Organisations and brands can also promote their own content using YouTube’s Promote Your Video feature, and can post adverts through 
Google AdWords"
"
Using social services such as YouTube allows video creators to tap into an existing 
community of avid video viewers"
" For example, YouTube has changed the way we 
view video commercials"
" Marketers have shown that if an advert is good enough, 
many people will choose to watch it"
" Super Bowl commercials, for example, are 
highly anticipated each year, and the best ones receive millions of online video views"
" These are people who have chosen to watch this advert at a media cost of zero! Other advertisers have realised that far longer adverts can be created and 
uploaded"
" As long as the content is good, people will watch (and hopefully share)"
" 
Time constraints are not the same as they are for television networks"
Online video sharing also makes it possible for conferences to generate a far greater audience than ever before
" The companies that run these conferences 
are able to engage with a massive audience by posting videos of the conference 
presentations – an excellent example of content marketing"
 TED (www
ted
"com) 
and Nokia’s, which runs Nokia World, are excellent examples of organisations that increase interest by making their remarkable presentations available for free"

"3 Blogging
 
A blog is a website where entries (blog posts) are typically displayed in reverse chronological order"
" Technorati, a blog and social media tracking engine, defines 
a blog as a “regularly updated journal published on the web”"
" Blogs usually allow 
readers to comment on blog posts"
" A typical blog will feature text, images and links to other related blogs and websites"
"
 
Figure 8"
" Technorati, a blog aggregator "
"
Blogs can be about anything – from personal journeys to political commentary and 
everything in between"
 They can be written by one person or by a group or company
" Some are aimed at the blogger’s immediate family and friends, and others rival 
leading newspapers in terms of reach and readership"
" Blogs are mostly text based, 
but can comprise solely of images, videos, audio or a combination of any of these"
"
According to Wikipedia, by 2012, there were 77 million Tumblr blogs and 56"
"6

Whether blogging as an individual or a company, there is plenty to be gained from the process"
" You can: 
• Create an online identity"
"
• Create a voice for yourself or your company"
"
• Promote engagement with your audience"
"
• Build a community"
"
Corporate blogging 
Blogs can be very successful marketing tools"
" They’re an excellent way to communicate with staff, investors, industry members, journalists and prospective customers"
" Blogging also helps to foster a community around a brand, and provides an opportunity to garner immediate feedback on developments"
" 
Generally, the tasks that a blogger undertakes include:
• Writing posts
• Replying to comments from readers
• Monitoring other blogs within the industry
• Keeping up to date with the latest industry news
• Building relationships with other bloggers in the community
• Commenting on other blogs
It is important to outline a strategy and establish guidelines before starting a 
corporate blog, especially as there will most likely be a number of contributors"
" Transparency and honesty are important, but companies should also be aware of sensitive information being blogged"
" If there are ‘no go’ areas, they need to 
be clearly defined to the parties involved"
" While certain topics can be restricted, 
ultimately the bloggers should be granted the freedom to express both negative and positive points of view about the approved topics"
" 
Positive claims are more believable if the blogger is able to express negative views 
as well"
" For example, Robert Scoble, in his popular blog www"
scobleizer
"com, 
admitted that the Firefox browser was better than Microsoft’s Internet Explorer"
 Robert Scoble was an employee of Microsoft at the time
" This honesty gave him a credible voice, and so his positive views on Microsoft are respected by the 
community"
"
Corporate blog content should be:
• Industry relevant
• Appealing to your target market
• Transparent and honest
• Personal and entertaining
• Related to what’s going on in the blogosphere 
• Posted regularlySocial Media Channels  ›  Content creation Social Media Channels  ›  Content creation
NOTE
It can take a lot of time for 
a blog to gain momentum - don’t get discouraged if your audience is small initially, and stick to your content strategy"

"382 383Blogging and SEO
Search engines value regular, fresh content, and blogging can create just that"
" 
The more you post, the more often search engines will crawl your site, looking 
for additional, relevant content"
" Basing your blog on the keyword strategy created 
during the SEO process can also ensure that your website ranks for those key phrases"
" Blogs, by their social nature, can also increase the incoming links to your website"
"
Using a blog platform designed to be search engine-friendly is crucial to harnessing 
the SEO power of blogging"
" Some features of SEO-friendly blogging platforms:
• Each blog post should be assigned a unique page that can easily be accessed and indexed by the search engines (this is called a permalink)"
"
• It should be possible to tag pages with keywords relevant to your SEO strategy"
"
• Each post should be able to have its own unique metadata (title, description and key phrases)"
"
• Social sharing and bookmarking functionality should be built in"
" 
Promoting blogs
While there may be around 200 million blogs on the web, it doesn’t mean that all of these will still be up and running a year from now (Hughes, 2013)"
" Longevity rests 
in the hands of the blogger, but here are some tips to raise the profile of a blog:
• List the blog in blog directories: while they’re not as popular as search 
engines, many Internet users do visit them when looking for information"
" 
Examples include Blogarama (www"
blogarama
"com), Bloggeries (www"
bloggeries
com) and BlogCatalog (www
blogcatalog
com)
" 
• Ping web services with updated content: sites such as Ping-o-Matic (pingomatic"
com) and Feed Shark (feedshark
brainbliss
"com) offer a 
service whereby they ping multiple web services, blog directories and 
search engines to let them know that a blog has fresh content"
" 
• Use TrackBacks: If a blogger writes a new post commenting on, or 
referring to, an entry on your blog, and both blogging tools support the TrackBack protocol, then the commenting blogger can notify your blog with a ‘TrackBack ping’"
" The receiving blog will typically display 
summaries and links of all the commenting entries below the original 
entry"
 This allows for conversations spanning several blogs that readers can easily follow
" • Participate in the blogosphere: You can’t expect anyone to engage on 
your blog if you’re not engaging on theirs"
" It’s all about fostering a sense 
of community"
"
• Make use of aggregators: Examples of aggregators include Technorati and Reddit (www"
reddit
com)
"
Blogs as a marketing tool
Blogs are powerful because of their reach, their archives (information is seldom 
deleted and is thus available long after it has been posted) and the trust that other 
consumers place in them"
" For a marketer, they present opportunities to learn how 
others perceive your brand and to engage with the audience"
 Some brands get this right; some get it wrong
" 
We’ve provided some guidelines for corporate blogging, but marketers do not 
need to be bloggers to benefit from this tool"
" As with all other social media, blogs 
provide a snapshot of audience sentiment regarding a brand"
" Marketers can also 
listen to blog activity around competitors to gain market insights"
"
Although blogging is the best way to engage with bloggers, companies can also 
interact with bloggers by commenting on relevant posts"
" Demonstrating the capacity to listen to bloggers and then respond using the same medium can reap 
tremendous benefits with this community"
"
Blogging platforms that can be used to set up a blog quickly and easily include:
• WordPress (www"

"4 Microblogging
 
Microblogging is a form of blogging that allows a user to publish short text updates, 
usually limited to 140 characters, that can be viewed by anyone or restricted 
to a specific community"
" The most popular microblogging service is Twitter  
(www"
twitter
"com), which was launched in July 2006"
" These 140-characters posts, 
called tweets, are usually short thoughts or links to interesting articles"
" As of June 
2013, Twitter has more than 500 million members, with 400 million Tweets being 
written each day (Smith, 2013)"
"
 NOTE
Tumblr is a unique 
blogging platform that encourages very short posts, usually featuring images"
 It falls somewhere between a blog and a microblog

 Profiles on Twitter can be branded to represent your organisation’s identity
"
Twitter has some specific jargon that it’s worth knowing:
• Tweet: A post on made on Twitter"
" 
• @username: users are denoted with @ and their chosen name (e"
g
"  
@robstokes for www"
twitter
com/robstokes)
" Tweets can be directed to a 
specific user simply by typing their @username at the start of the tweet"
"
• Hashtag: users can categorise their posts by adding a word or phrased 
prefaced with the # symbol (for example, #DigitalMarketing)"
" The 
hashtag will become a link that you can click to see other tweets that 
share this tag"
" You can also choose to follow a hashtag, meaning that you will see all public messages with that tag, whether you follow the user or not"
" This can be a very useful way of collating information at events such 
as conferences"
" If you’re not at the event, you can still follow messages 
from the event by following the hashtag"
" For those at the event, all tagged messages can be broadcast in a shared location"
"
• Trending: if a hashtag or keyword is used very frequently in a short time, 
it can become a trending topic and is displayed to the left of a user’s tweet 
stream"
" Events of global interest usually feature heavily, but sometimes 
brands can trend, too (although not always for the right reasons)"
"
• Retweet (RT):  retweeting means reposting somebody else’s tweet to your 
own profile, along with their user name"
 The letters RT are usually added to the start of the tweet to indicate that it comes from someone else
"Twitter has proved immensely valuable in breaking events, where real-time information is useful and powerful"
" For example, Twitter users broke the news of 
events such as the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings"

brands and individuals"
" Many brands use it successfully for rapid customer service 
(for example, @comcastcares, @klm and @mwebguy)"

Its immediacy allows for news to be broadcast to dedicated followers and fans 
first, as pop star Lady Gaga has done with single releases (@ladygaga)"

"5 Podcasting
 
A podcast is a digital radio (or video) programme downloadable from the Internet"
" It 
is possible to subscribe to a podcast as one would to a blog"
" You can listen to a whole 
range of programmes and voices; just as blogs have allowed people to become 
writers without having to deal with a media channel controlled by someone else, podcasting has allowed anyone who fancies doing so to become a broadcaster"
 Many traditional radio shows are now also available in podcast format
"
‘Podcatching’ software allows you to download the latest edition of any podcast 
you subscribe to automatically"
 Most people use iTunes – go to www
apple
"com/
itunes/store for loads more information on podcasting and a huge list of available 
podcasts"
 You can listen on your computer or transfer the file to an iPod or MP3 player
" Podcasts are usually free, and the most successful ones have very high-quality content and production value"
" 
Creating a podcast
Podcasts are usually recorded and edited using home equipment, and done for the love of it"
" There is specialised podcasting software available, such as 
Apple’s Garage Band or QuickTime Pro"
" These packages make it quite simple to 
record, mix and format the audio files correctly"
" Just like bloggers, though, many podcasters are trying to figure out ways of making money from their podcasts and turn listeners into revenue"
" 
Podcasts as a marketing tool
Podcasts offer an incredible opportunity for marketers"
" The bottom line is that you now have a way of getting content to your target markets without having to 
persuade a media channel to carry it or to pay huge advertising rates"
"
Podcasts are: 
• Targetable: you can create highly relevant, niche content and then 
promote it to a specific target market"
"
• Measurable: you can see exactly how many downloads and subscribers you have"
"
• Controllable: it’s your content"
"
• Responsive: set up a blog alongside your podcast and alter content according to the comments; you are actually having a conversation with your market"
"
• Boundary free: it’s the Internet"
"
• Relatively inexpensive: the equipment, software and skills are readily and cheaply available, and there are few or no distribution costs"
" However, the content must be:
• Excellent quality: like anything on the Internet, it is just as easy to 
unsubscribe as it is to subscribe"
" Quality content is what keeps listeners 
coming back"
"
• Real and valuable: while there is value in having product or service information embedded in a website, there is no point at all in producing an audio version of a company brochure as a regular podcast"
 Consumers are losing faith in the content of traditional media
" Even if editorial is not 
actually paid for, a lot of the time it has been influenced in some way by 
advertisers"
"  Although there are podcasts that carry adverts, people can fast forward straight past them, and the chance of real success lies in 
branded content"
"
This is not about advertising or even just product information"
" It is about coming up with ideas for real programmes that, through informing or entertaining, enhance 
your customers’ experience of your brand"
"

"6 Bookmarking and aggregating 
 
If there are websites you visit often, or that you would like to keep as a reference to come back to, it is easy to use your browser to ‘bookmark’ them"
" This means that 
you store the URL so that you can locate it again easily"
" It also gives you a personal 
library of websites that you can store on your computer"
"
Social bookmarking sites, however, allow you to store these links online, use tags 
to describe them, and share these lists with other users"
" Some of these sites allow 
you to submit URLs that other users vote on, while others allow you to use the tags 
saved to browse through the lists and libraries that have been generated"
"
Websites that encourage users to submit content to bookmarking and aggregating 
sites use chiclets"
 These are buttons placed around the content that make it easier to submit and share the article
"
Figure 11"
 Examples of chiclets
"
These services allow you to see what the community of web users finds useful, 
interesting or humorous"
" You are able to find other users with similar interests to 
yours, and explore the websites that they have found that you might not have come 
across yet"

"
Delicious (www"

Internet users organise online media in a quick, easy-to-access and user-
friendly format"
" The primary function of Delicious is to allow you to store all of 
your bookmarks online and then access those bookmarks from any computer anywhere in the world"
" Delicious is more of a community-based tool than other 
social bookmarking sites, as it allows others to see your bookmarks"
" Essentially, 
it lets you identify other people whose interests and concerns parallel yours and grants you access to all of their bookmarks as well"
"
Digg (www"

content that other users can vote on"
" Popularity, based on votes, moves the

content sites, so much so that servers can crash if the leap in visitors is unexpected"
" Getting into the top listings is the goal of many a marketer, but any attempt to 
manipulate listings usually backfires and can generate plenty of community 
backlash"
"
The communities around these sites differ demographically, and this is reflected 
in the content"
" For example, Digg has been technology focused, while Reddit tends 
to feature more general news"
Stumbleupon (www

interests, based on how other web users tag content"
 Users select categories of interest and bookmark URLs to those categories

Social media have also seen the introduction of location services such as 
Foursquare (foursquare"

location)"
" These services allow users to ‘check in’ at locations they visit with 
equipment such as mobile phones and tablets"
"
Figure 14"
 Users can check in at physical locations on Facebook
"
 
By checking in, users are able to share their location with their friends and find 
others who are checked in as well"
" Depending on the tool, they can add reviews, post 
messages and upload photos of the locations they are checked into"
" Foursquare 
lets users become ‘mayors’ of locations they have visited more than anyone else"
" 
These location services appeal to marketers for a number of reasons, since they 
can obtain, engage with and retain customers by leveraging their interactions with the real-world"
" For instance, if people see their friends checking in at certain 
places, they are more likely to want to go there, particularly if their friends have 
posted a positive review of the location"
" 
These services also offer rewards and special deals to users who have checked in, 
incentivising them to return and share the location with their friends"
" Starbucks offers a range of location-based incentives, for example, offering all mayors of 
Starbucks stores a discount at any branch"

"8 Tracking social media campaigns 
 
As with any digital marketing tactic, you need to be able to track and measure your 
campaigns in order to understand how successful they are, and what you can do 
to improve them"
"
With most social networking channels, you do not actually host your presence, 
which means that custom tracking is limited"
" There is often a strong reliance on 
the built-in tracking offered by the various channels, although new third-party tracking services are emerging and offering competitive and sophisticated tools 
(often for a fee)"
" In some cases, it is also possible to integrate tracking to some 
extent if you are directing traffic to a web property that you own"

" When selecting a 
URL shortener, consider whether or not they keep the click analytics private"

"9 Social media marketing: Rules of 
engagement
 
Social media implies a democratisation of information, and requires authenticity 
and openness from those who deliberately use it for marketing"
" This means that 
good and bad stories spread and stick around"
" Jeff Jarvis may have had problems 
with Dell way back in 2005, but you can easily find all the relevant information with 
a quick Google search for ‘Dell hell’"
"Although they are engaging publicly with a wide audience, marketers need to remember that they are communicating with individuals"
" While marketers should 
engage in the conversation, and possibly lead it, they cannot control it"
"
Marketing to content creators
Because they are so influential, approaching online influencers should form a part of any PR strategy"
" 
Supply content creators with the tools and resources they need to talk easily about 
your product, including links to your social profiles, Twitter handles and hashtags"
"
Marketing to content consumers
Social media allow anyone to have a say, and the same tools that are available to individuals are available to companies"
" Company blogs allow a brand to build a 
personality and to interact with their target market"
" Entertainment created and 
spread via social media increases brand touchpoints"
" Using the same channels that are available to your consumer aids in understanding the consumer, and levels the plane of conversation"
"
When using social media to reach out to content consumers, go to where your 
consumers are"
 The media you use is dictated by your users
" For example, a 
nightclub for students can create a Facebook Page to advertise its weekly specials, 
and interact with fans, while Land Rover enthusiasts may be more comfortable with a discussion forum"
"
With all interactions, marketing messages need to be clearly identified and 
labelled, with a disclaimer added if necessary"
 Trying to hide them as something else will only decrease your authenticity
"
Marketing to content sharers
Content sharers are content consumers who also pass your message on, whether it’s by chat or email, by sharing a link on a blog or by submitting your content to 
a bookmarking or aggregating service"
" They are a crucial link in the chain that 
passes your message around"
 Make it as easy as possible to share your content by using chiclets and unique and easy-to-read URLs
"
Advertise on social media platforms
While marketers can use the tools of social media to convey their message, the characteristics that define a social media website are also important"
" Social media 
allows users to express themselves, and this means that demographic information 
can be compiled to allow for more useful and targeted advertising"

People are finding it easier to switch off or ignore traditional advertising, 
particularly through traditional media environments such as TV or radio"
" Social 
media gives brands the opportunity to interact with customers through relevant 
and targeted communications that customers can choose to engage with on their terms"
" For example, a consumer may visit a branded YouTube channel as opposed to deliberately ignoring advert breaks on television"
"
Social media’s potential to go viral is one of its greatest benefits – if users like your 
content, they will share it with their own communities"
" It also allows marketers to capitalise on the creativity of their consumers to spread their message further, 
often at very low cost"
"
Social media allows you to engage with an online community and allows you to 
connect your brand to the appropriate audience, creating an online community 
for your brand and its supporters"
" Social media has created a forum for brand 
evangelists"
" 
The numerous interactions allow you to garner feedback from your communities, 
which helps drive both future business insights and innovation, as well as marketing strategies"
" You can learn more about your audience’s likes, dislikes, 
behaviours and needs"
" 
However, companies need also be aware that bad messages spread as quickly as 
good ones, and the connectedness that can prove so useful can also be a conduit 
for negative messages and brand attacks"
" 
Social media facilitates a two-way conversation between customer and company"
" 
This necessitates that the company shifts approach from ‘deploy and watch’ to one of constant involvement with the audience"
"
This new landscape is one in which the customer really is king, and any attempt to 
dethrone the king can have dire consequences"
" Efforts to control the conversation 
in social media are soon found out, and can backfire horribly"
" Any company 
embarking on a social media strategy needs to be sure to monitor their reputation online regularly"
 It is crucial to know what is being said in order to be able to respond timeously and communicate in the social media sphere
"
Finally, never forget that special rules and laws apply when you are dealing with 
personal information provided by users – be very careful how and where you use 
this data"

"3 The solution
 
To achieve this, Col’Cacchio partnered with the social media team at Quirk to create the #PriceSlice Twitter campaign, a pay-with-a-tweet-inspired activation that would encourage Twitter users to 
eat more pizza"
" 
The campaign had the following objectives: 
• Increase the number of Twitter followers
• Increase consumer engagement
• Drive in-store sales
The campaign mechanism was simple yet effective, working on the basis of value exchange – tweets 
for discounts"
" Twitter users were prompted to tweet a message using the #PriceSlice hashtag, and 
the more tweets the hashtag received, the higher the in-store discount on Col’Cacchio pizzas"
"
Figure 16"
 The landing page for the Price Slice campaign
"
As people tweeted, Quirk automatically captured and recorded them"
" Once they reached a certain 
level, the temperature would rise on the thermometer represented on the campaign landing page"
"
 Figure 17"

"
The campaign also involved in-person activation through blogger engagement"
" Pizzas were delivered 
to selected bloggers, with the campaign message secretly hidden beneath the pizza slices"

"4 The results
 
The campaign got off to a great start"
" After one hour, the #PriceSlice hashtag was trending in Cape Town, and within three hours both @Colcacchio and #PriceSlice were trending in South Africa:

"398 399The results in the campaign showed the following:
• A total increase of 23% in Twitter followers through the course of the campaign, and in the 
days following it"
"
• Around 21% of the campaign website visitors returned to the site more than once, indicating that they were following the discount and were likely to visit a Col’Cacchio 
branch to take advantage of it"
"
• The campaign achieved a great deal of PR and blogger engagement through a variety of 
posts crafted around the campaign mechanism:

"During the course of the campaign, the Quirk social media team closely monitored the campaign 
and noted some other interesting observations:
• The campaign seemingly drew new individuals to the Twitter platform, since a number of users created Twitter accounts simply to participate in the promotion"

Twitter and other online channels:

"
Col’Cacchio and Quirk also went further to capture a range of data related to online mentions of 
the campaign"
" 
Here are some key observations:
• There was an increase of 440% in @mentions of the @Colcacchio Twitter handle during the 
campaign, when compared to the days prior to launch"
"
• There was also an increase of more than 800% in the number of @Colcacchio retweets during the campaign when compared to the week prior to it"
"
• Over 3 000 mentions of the #PriceSlice hashtag were achieved through the course of the campaign"
"
• As a result of the exposure of the campaign across various channels, the campaign reached just short of three million ‘opportunities to see’, meaning that the Price Slice initiative potentially reached almost three million Internet users"
" For example, if a Twitter user with 
2 000 followers tweeted about the campaign, then 2 000 people had ‘opportunity to see’"
"
• The majority of Price Slice conversation came from respected sources in the online community"
"
This campaign not only highlights the value of social media engagement for a brand, but also 
indicates how offering consumers something in return can really endear a brand to its followers"
" 
Col’Cacchio and Quirk embraced the strengths of Twitter and used the platform to build brand 
awareness in a positive and meaningful way"
"

"13 The bigger picture
 
Social media can tie in nicely with any of your other online marketing tactics – a holistic digital marketing strategy is always the best strategy"
"
Social media is inextricably linked to content marketing strategy, since content is the foundation 
of any social media marketing endeavour – whether you’re creating digital copy, images, videos 
or other media"
"
Social media can have SEO benefits for a website"
" By using social media services, either to create 
or share content, websites can attract links and generate engagement, helping to enhance search engine rankings"
" Signing up to several social media channels can help a company to own a larger 
chunk of the search engine results page"
" Companies can also use their SEO keyword strategy to 
focus their social media efforts"
"
Social media can provide a targeted network for online advertising, allowing detailed demographic 
information to play a role in media planning and buying"
" Companies can also make use of increased consumer engagement to create interactive advertising for these mediums, such as advertising 
within videos and social network applications, or merely making use of increased time-on-page 
metrics to create more intricate advertising"
"
Affiliates often use the opportunities presented by social media to find new avenues for targeted 
traffic, resulting in revenue growth for the company being marketed this way"
"
Social media plays a large role in online monitoring and reputation management, viral marketing 
and digital PR"
" Social media is used to express opinion, and so is the bedrock of online reputation"
" 
Any company that wants to communicate to this connected audience needs to listen to social media"
" 
14"
"14 Summary
 
Social media refers to the creation and sharing of content by consumers on the Internet"

"1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of social media, and detailed 
some of the major social media channels and platforms"
" This chapter addresses 
how to use these spaces strategically"
" While the channels and platforms available 
may change, the foundations of a successful social media strategy won’t"
" By planning and thinking strategically, while leaving room to be flexible and dynamic, you’ll be able to make the most of what social networking has to offer"
"
Social media channels are communication channels that can be used to solve 
business, marketing and communication challenges"
" As more time is spent by 
consumers online, and that time is increasingly dominated by social media usage, organisations need to incorporate social media into their marketing strategies"
" The Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project shows that 67% of 
Internet users visit social networking sites (Center, 2013)"
" The Nielsen and NM 
Incite’s Social Media Report  indicates that American computer users spend about 20% of their time online visiting social networks, while mobile users spend 30% of 
their time on these sites (Nielsen, 2012)"
" This means more time is spent on social 
media than on any other category of sites"

Social MediaSocial Media Strategy  ›  Using social media to solve business challenges Social Media Strategy  ›  Introduction
NOTE
Not all businesses face 
all of these challenges - which ones are relevant to your brand?"
408 40915
3
"1 Communication and outreach
 
Unlike other options, social media offers brands an effective two-way communication 
and real-time broadcast channel"
" This bi-directional communication is what 
makes social communities so exciting (and challenging)"
" Just as consumers can 
communicate with each other, and send messages to businesses and brands, so businesses and brands can use this medium to communicate with and reach out to the public"
" Increasingly, social media is becoming a highly effective public communications tool"
"
Businesses, governments and other organisations use Twitter and Facebook to 
broadcast timely messages, allowing interested parties to keep informed in real-
time"
" This is fast becoming a vital aspect of newsworthy and breaking news events such as elections, disasters and global sports"
 Many organisations also use social media tools to broadcast service updates
"
15"
3
"2 Community management
 
Social media platforms are built around communities, and are sometimes virtual representations of real-world networks and communities"
" This feature of social 
media can be used to build and maintain a community around, or supported by, 
your organisation"
"
‘Community manager’ is a role that has risen to prominence as more organisations 
start using social media, but it has always been an important role in any community – from groups that thrive on forums to communities run on platforms such as 
Facebook"
"
Creating, building and nurturing a community means that organisations don’t just 
participate in conversations that are happening around and about them, but also 
actively lead and guide those conversations"
" These communities are generally made up of the organisation’s biggest fans: brand evangelists who feel as if they 
have a big stake in that organisation"
" This creates an environment where those 
fans can interact directly with the organisation, and where the organisation can send messages directly to those fans and solicit their feedback"
"
 Figure 2"
 MWEB responding to customer queries on Twitter 
"
Building and maintaining a community is a long-term project"
" It starts with 
determining what the best platform is for that community: something that already exists (such as Facebook), or a brand new platform specifically created for it (either 
from scratch or using a service such as Ning – www"
ning
com)
"
15"
3
"3 Support and customer service
 
Social media is becoming an additional customer service channel"
" As 
consumers are increasingly comfortable transacting online, there is an 
expectation that the businesses with which they transact will also respond 
to customer queries in the social space, as they would do through a call centre or email"
" Some customers have found that problems or questions on social media tend to be resolved more quickly, as brands are wary of having 
unresolved issues left out in public"
" For any organisation that runs a social 
community, customer service is often one of the channel’s primary functions"
"

Ideally, you want to be 
the trusted go-to source

your industry"

410 411Figure 3
 FNB responding to customer queries on Twitter 
"
Interestingly, customer service in social media channels starts to become 
collaborative, with customers assisting each other and, in doing so, reducing the reliance on the organisation for support"
" Collaborative support tools such as 
Get Satisfaction (www"
getsatsfaction
com) are used to great effect
" According to 
Get Satisfaction’s website, over 70 000 communities use their service, including Microsoft and Intuit’s Mint (Get Satisfaction, 2013)"
" Even businesses that use social 
media channels such as Facebook for customer support can see other community 
members helping each other"
"
15"

"4 Reputation management
 
The need for online reputation management and monitoring is growing, and brands are now realising this"
" Through the combination of search and social 
media, all mentions of a brand or individual are only a quick search away, whether 
they are positive or negative"
" Social media are in one of the spaces where a brand or individual can easily respond to mentions, create a stir, or find ways to further their own agenda"
"
Brands can use social media in two ways to manage their online reputations – first, 
by monitoring what customers and fans are saying to identify issues proactively; 
and second, as a means of communicating and getting their side of the story out"
 15
3
"5 Advertising and awareness
 
Where there is an audience, there is advertising"
" The more time people spend in social media, the more brands want to advertise there"
" It’s not just the time 
people spend on social networks that make them appealing to advertisers – it’s 
also the rich demographic and psychographic targeting opportunities"
" Adverts can be targeted based on the profile information that individuals provide, either overtly or through their actions on the social network"
"
Most social networks offer advertising options that are accessible to both the small 
advertiser as well as the big spender"
" This is a dynamic space, as the networks 
experiment with different formats and models"
" The advertising opportunities for 
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn are covered in full in the Online Advertising 
chapter"
"
15"
3
"6 Sales and lead generation
 
Adding a social layer to a commercial transaction can create a richer experience for online consumers"
" These can be based overtly on social connections, or on 
inferred connections based on behaviour"
"
Levi’s Friends Store (store"
levi
com) is an example of the former
" Visiting the 
website while signed in to Facebook allows you to see which of your friends like 
which styles"
 Levi’s can then present this information with data that includes your friends’ upcoming birthdays
" This is useful feedback for you, as you can see which 
styles are more popular among your friends, as well as users in general"
" This 
provides insight for Levi’s on which styles are more popular than others"
" 
An excellent example of the layer based on inferred connections is Amazon’s 
collaborative filtering"
 If you’ve browsed on Amazon
"com, you will no doubt have seen product information such as “People who bought this also bought that”"
" In 
real time, based on consumer purchase behaviour, Amazon presents products that 
you are likely to have an interest in, based on people who browsed and purchased products that you like"
" Although you may not realise it, this is a social layer on the online shopping experience"
"
Social communities can also be lead generation or sales generation assets"
" 
Within Facebook, for example, applications on brand pages can allow eCommerce 
transactions or lead generation within the Facebook environment"

"7 Search engine optimisation (SEO)
 
Social media plays an important role in SEO"
" It provides additional assets that can 
be optimised so that a brand ‘owns’ the results page for searches for their brand"
" 
A savvy SEO strategy will also make use of social media assets, links and likes for 
strengthening the position of other web assets in the search engine results pages"
"
Figure 4"
 Branded social media platforms appearing in Google search results
"
With a little bit of planning and keyword research, a brand can use social assets 
effectively to own searches on their brand name"
" This ties back neatly to managing 
their online reputation, too"
"
15"
3
"8 Insight and research
 
Social media can be a very powerful insight and research asset, but the information needs to be judged in its proper context"
" When you are planning a campaign, social 
media can provide a rich source of data, both demographic and preference based"
"
You can use the information people share freely to understand more about your 
market, brand or product"
" ORM tools help you to track mentions and sentiment, 
giving you insight into how you are perceived"
" Using social network ad planners, 
such as Facebook or YouTube’s offerings, can give you rich information about the 
size of your market, and things that they like"
 You can measure sentiment and the changing number of mentions to help you understand the impact of other campaigns
 These can be offline or online campaigns
"Building your online community also gives you a group you can reach out to for information and feedback, creating an always-on online focus group"
" However, 
bear in mind that they are inherently biased just by the fact that they would join 
your social community"
" 
Doing a Twitter search of branded keywords can reveal what users are saying about 
your brand"
" You could also use communities such as Flickr to see what people are sharing about their lives, without even realising"
 Head over to www
flickr
"com and 
search for ‘in my fridge’ for a snapshot of this in action"
"
This social data can be very valuable, but must be treated correctly"
" It is qualitative 
and quantitative information, and is in many ways secondary research"
" For 
research purposes, it can and should be used to help form research questions for further evaluation"
"
15"
"4 Step-by-step guide to creating a social 
media strategy
 
Social media is a fast-moving channel, which means proper planning is vital to 
success"
" Effective social media strategies come from embracing the fact that social media is a two-way communication channel: organisations interacting in 
this space need the resources not only to push messages out, but to deal quickly 
with the messages coming in, too"
"
Planning is the foundation of success"
" Here is one method to approaching social 
media strategically"
"
1"
" Get buy-in
It’s important that there is buy-in for your foray into social media"
" It may be seen as a free resource, but even if you are not paying for exposure, there is a time 
and resource investment required"
" A number of stakeholders will need to be 
aware of your social media plans, and these may be both internal and external"
" And, of course, you will need sign-off for any budgeting or additional resourcing requirements"
"
Addressing the various stakeholders will also force you to do the necessary 
research and planning to take the next steps"
"
2"
" Listen and understand the landscape 
It’s important to take a step back first"
" Social media is more than the social spaces 
you may interact with in your personal capacity"
" A good first step to understanding 
the landscape is to listen"

""
"414 415Some important questions to answer include:
• What conversation already exists around your brand, your industry and 
your competitors? 
• Do they have the facts?
• Where does it take place? 
• Who is doing most of the talking? What can you, as a brand, add to this conversation? Is it valuable?
Online monitoring tools such as BrandsEye (www"
brandseye
com) or Radian6 (www
radian6
"com) can help you with the listening part of your planning, but in the early stages you may want to start with free tools such as Google Alerts 
 
(www"
google
com/alerts)
"
3"
" Analyse
Using all the data you have been gathering, analyse! Think critically about social media and your brand, as well as your brand’s broader marketing, communication and business challenges"
" All of this should be looked at within the context of 
the information that you already know about your local marketing and business 
environment"
"
Your outcomes here should include:
• A list of the social channels and platforms your brand should be in"
" This 
is based on who your customers are, where they interact, and where 
they expect to interact with you"
"
• Non-official groups or communities that already exist, which may have been created by fans"
"
• An overview of the existing conversation (volume, frequency and sentiment), as well as any content or conversation themes that occur"
"
• An overview of what your competitors are doing in this space"
"
• A list of potential brand evangelists and influencers in your industry"
" 
4"
" Set objectives 
Your objectives are the desired outcome of your social media strategy"
  These should be based within the context of your marketing and business challenges
"
Firstly, you need to address how you will use social media for your organisation"
" 
You then need to set objectives for each of those"
" To make them tangible and measurable, establish key performance indicators 
(KPIs) for your objectives, with benchmarks and targets where appropriate"
"
Determine SMART objectives:
Figure 5"
 The various elements of a SMART objective
"
For example, your objective could be to grow a community of fans around your 
brand in a particular country"
" Your KPI might therefore be fan numbers, and you 
could set a target of 5 000 Facebook fans over six months"
"
5"
" Create an action plan
Once you have a clear idea of what you want, you can begin compiling an action 
plan to get there"
" 
This is where you need to make sure that you have created the necessary 
documents and processes that form the foundation of your plan"
" 
You will need to:
• Decide on the roles and responsibilities of the project team and other 
stakeholders"
"
• Determine what social media tools you will make use of"
"
• Commit to a frequency and volume of activity, as well as how quickly you will respond"
"
• Develop a conversation plan"
"
• Create tone of voice guidelines, frequently asked questions, community guidelines and content plans"

" Implement
This is the fun part! It’s time to kick off your plans and put all that research and 
thought into action"
 Set up your platforms according to the guidelines they specify
" 
Alert stakeholders that you are starting your engagement plans, and make sure 
you have tracking in place"
" Continue to monitor for mentions of your organisation, and responses to your messages"
" Keep to your general plan, but be prepared to adapt"
"
7"
" Track, analyse, optimise
The beautiful thing about digital marketing is that you can track every single 
user interaction and use this information to learn from and improve your efforts 
continually"
" You should track the success of your social media campaigns on an ongoing basis, and set milestones for your team at less frequent intervals (every 
couple of months or so), when you will sit down and do a more in-depth review"
"
There are several tools you can use for tracking social media"
" You will need to build 
a suite of tools to suit your measurement and reporting requirements"
"
 
Platform insights
Facebook, YouTube, and other social media platforms offer analytics and insights"
" 
These are a useful starting point for reporting on your social media efforts, from 
numbers of followers or fans, to interactions with the content you share"
"
Web analytics
If you are using social media channels to send traffic to your own website, you 
should tag the links so that you can segment that traffic in your website reports"
" 
In Google Analytics (www"

your organisation"
" To ensure that there is consistency across the various channels, 
processes and guidelines should be a part of your social media strategy, and should be created before you take any action on social media"
"
Start with the documentation and processes you already have in place for marketing 
and communication: for example, brand and tone of voice guidelines, or PR 
policies"
" Build on these to create a robust foundation that suits this spontaneous, 
dynamic space"
"
A social media checklist is a good starting point to make sure that you have 
everything in place"

"1 Community guidelines
 
As well as a privacy policy and terms and conditions, it’s a good idea to establish 
community guidelines for the communities you manage, especially when the 
community is on behalf of a brand"
"  Community guidelines help to set the tone for 
the community, and are useful to refer to should community members behave in a way that is undesirable"
" They indicate what will, and will not, be tolerated, such as hate speech, profanity, discrimination and other inappropriate content"
" Of course, 
community guidelines don’t prevent such behaviour, but are useful to fall back on 
should you need to remove comments or community members"
"
Guidelines should be friendly, with the tone in keeping with your community or 
brand"
" You can use the information here as a starting point, but customise it for your situation"

"2 Content plan
 
Content plans help you to plan your community conversations"
" More than that, they 
are also useful, centralised planning documents that ensure that various teams 
are all aware of each other’s efforts, and that communications are integrated"
" For 
any kind of content and communication strategy, content plans are invaluable"
" 
As you learnt in the Content Marketing Strategy chapter, reaching social audiences 
requires you to create content that truly resonates with them"
" Successful social content must be interesting, relevant, shareable and remarkable"
" It is especially useful to plan and create social content around your content pillars, since this 
gives you a solid structure and starting point to follow"
"
To start creating a conversation calendar, you should plot everything that is relevant 
to your community"
" This could include public events, dates and anniversaries, or 
events and communications already planned by your organisation"
"
You should also use your conversation calendar for reporting"
" Keeping track of 
interactions and responses to your planned posts will help you to determine what kind of posts your community responds to, what days are best for posting, and 
what frequency works best for your community"
"
Planning the conversation helps to keep momentum, especially in the early days 
of building a community"
" However, it should not replace spontaneity – this is a 
conversation, after all!

"3 Communication and escalation protocol
 
An established communication and escalation protocol helps to ensure that all 
parties are aware of procedures for handling social messages, and can respond 
as appropriate"
" This is especially important for large organisations where several 
people might be interacting in social media on behalf of a brand, or where several 
departments or agencies have a stake in the organisation’s social media presence"
"A communication and escalation protocol should include:
• Anticipated messages, frequently asked questions and appropriate, 
standard responses (for both positive and negative situations)"
"
• Guidelines for determining the sentiment and risk of messages, which includes a flagging system for comments that need more senior attention"
"
• The crisis management process to follow if a brand crisis erupts on social 
media"
"
• An escalation plan for messages that need signoff or further consideration"
"
• Contact details of relevant stakeholders"
"
• Guidelines for responding, including response rate, standard messages, 
brand voice and tone"

"6 Dealing with opportunities and threats
 
The use of social media has equipped consumers with a voice and a platform, 
and the ability to amplify their views and truly inform their decision making"
" 
The connected nature of the Internet makes these views easy to share, and the 
accessibility of social media tools makes it easy for other consumers to find these views, and respond and build on them"
 All of this contributes to the perception of the brand
"
The best way to show that you are listening to customer comments, complaints and 
questions online is the same as with a normal conversation"
" Comment when it’s 
appropriate, listen with interest, be polite, be respectful, and add value wherever possible"
 Brands should become active participants in the conversation
" 
Brands that are successful in communicating with their audiences are constantly 
on the lookout for opportunities to propel their brand forward, and are keeping 
their eyes peeled for risks that may threaten their reputation"
" In both situations, 
the power sits in how the brand responds"
 This response can range from a direct engagement to a full new marketing campaign
 Ultimately it depends on how powerful the opportunity or risk is
"

"1 When to talk (and when not to)
When everything being said is nice
A fantastic position to be in is that every possible mention is overwhelmingly positive"
 Well done
" However, that does not mean that there is nothing to do"
" 
During this time, the brand must do everything in its power to drive high volumes 
of conversation"
" 
Stakeholders are being positive about the brand because their expectations are 
being exceeded"
" Unfortunately, expectations change"
" Brands need to stay on their toes and constantly be on the lookout for new and innovative ways to meet and 
develop their brand promise"
" 
When everything being said is neutral
If this is the case, it sounds as if the company is very boring – not a good way to 
get attention"
" As Seth Godin  puts it, “Safe is risky” (Godin, 2010)"
" If a company is 
playing it so safe that no one can be bothered to send either praise or criticism 
its way, it’s in danger of being forgotten"
 The next step is no one talking about the company at all
"When negative things are being said
Negative statements should be understood as broken brand promises"
" There is underperformance on expectation, and it must be dealt with as a matter of high 
priority"
" During this period, brands need to be very careful not to stir up any more 
conversation than is absolutely necessary"
" That said, it’s certainly not all doom and gloom"
" If the conversation is broadly negative, it is normally because there is some underlying problem, and this information provides the business with focus 
to resolve it"
"
Complaints are from stakeholders who have had dealings with a company which 
hasn’t met their expectations"
" By complaining, this customer is, often unwittingly, giving the company the opportunity to make things right, and is probably indicating 
where the company can improve"
" Usually, the skilled customer service department 
of a company should deal with these"
" They should also share insights with the business strategy department so that the underlying problems can be prioritised 
and resolved"
"
If a complaint is online, the resolution should be there as well, although you can try 
to have it taken offline first"
" Even though the customer service will likely take place 
either over email or by phone, posting a personalised comment in a blog post, for example, will demonstrate to the community that the company listens, responds, 
and serves the critical objective of actually resolving the underlying issues"
"
Criticism need not necessarily come from customers, but it is important to be 
aware of it"
" If a criticism involves false information, it should be corrected"
" And if 
the criticism is true, then it should be dealt with as such"
" 
15"

"2 Responding
 
Responding involves recognising that consumers hold the upper hand in the relationship"
" They are better trusted, there are more of them and, in most cases, 
the barriers to exit from a brand are relatively low"
" 
Customers dictate the channels of communication"
" An organisation needs to go to 
the consumer, not the other way around"
" Ignoring this will result in the business 
losing customers because they not willing to truly engage"
" This is why it is so important to research your audience and tailor your strategy to them – not vice 
versa"
"
When responding, be transparent, be honest, and treat the person as you would 
like to be treated"
" At all times, remember that you are engaged in conversation, 
not a dictation"

"7 Step-by-step guide for recovering from 
an online brand attack
 
These rules to recovery provide a practical approach for brands facing an online 
threat"
"
15"
7
"1 Step 1: Be prepared 
 
No brand is immune from an online brand attack"
" The best brands have strategies in place to identify a reputation crisis immediately and respond to it quickly enough 
to stop the negative word of mouth spreading"
" 
Keep your brand in front of consumers by engaging in the conversation"
" This can 
be done by making use of blogs, communicating with customers, and being as 
open and honest as possible"
" Engaging in, and leading, the conversation allows you to build an authentic voice"
" If a crisis hits, you will be well placed to respond in 
a way that is authentic"
"
15"
7
"2 Step 2: Act immediately! 
 
The easiest way to solve most brand attacks is to respond quickly"
" A brand that 
shows it is listening and does indeed care will go far when it comes to ensuring a 
solid online reputation"
 Acknowledge what has been said and react accordingly
" 
15"
7
3 Step 3: If what they’re saying is false
""
""
" 
 
If the attack on your brand is factually incorrect, send the person evidence that 
they are wrong, and in a friendly tone, ask them to remove or retract the entry, and 
offer to keep them informed of future news"
" If the person doesn’t react or respond, 
add a comment"
" 
15"
7
4 Step 4: If what they’re saying is true
""
""
" 
 
If the mention is negative but true, send your side of the story and try as hard as you can to take the conversation offline"
" If appropriate, apologise and offer to make 
amends"
 15
7
"5 Step 5: Keep the negative pages out of the 
search engines 
 
Keeping more people from reading negative things about your brand is imperative"
" 
Knock them off the first page of the results with basic SEO and some social media 
pages, such as Facebook, Twitter or blog posts"
" Keep adding pages and links until 
you’ve forced the offending pages out of sight"
"

"8 Social media risks and challenges
 
Any social media strategy should account for the risks and challenges of interacting 
in this environment, and should incorporate a protocol for dealing with these risks"
" 
Mistakes on the web can take a long time to recover from"
"
Some of the common risks and challenges are listed below"
"
 
No one cares"
" Especially when building a community from scratch, it can be 
difficult in the beginning to get the traction you want"
" This is why understanding 
the landscape in the context of your organisation’s market is so important"
" Make 
sure you are interacting in the spaces where your customers are, and where they are happy to hear from you"
"
The social media space is used by unhappy customers (who are free to post 
detractive comments)"
" Even if the only feedback you are getting is negative, this is 
good feedback! Now you have an opportunity to do something about it"
"
It requires ongoing attention and monitoring"
" Social media channels may be free, 
but there is still a time and resource investment required to make your strategy a 
success"
" Understand what your objectives are for using social media, and budget the time required to meet those"
"
It can be difficult to measure the impact of the campaign"
" Social media can be 
difficult to measure, but that does not mean your campaigns are not successful"
" 
Don’t expect to find a solution (or success) overnight"
" Start with measuring things 
that can be measured easily, and watch for case studies in this space that will help you to turn your social media investment into revenue for your organisation"

The overall campaign was a huge success"
" Sentiment about the Super Bowl had a positive to 
negative ratio of 3 : 1 (It’s unusual to see one higher than 2 : 1)"
" The Command Center also 
achieved a daily average of 3 500 retweets and 2 500 Twitter favourites or Facebook Likes"
" They 
even managed to beat the National Football League’s Klout score!
The potential benefits of a system like this are great – from better public safety and smoother 
crowd management, to branding and social engagement"

Simply monitoring what people say can provide an incredible amount of useful, immediate 
feedback – something that’s essential in this fast-paced digital world (Laird, 2012)"

"2 The problem
Social media monitoring isn’t just for brands and products – it can be just as useful during live events"
" Take the Super Bowl, for example"
" It’s one of the most watched sporting events in the 
world, with over 100 million viewers"
" It’s also a massive real-world event, where 150 000 people 
crowd the city of Indianapolis for the day"
" 
15"

"3 The solution
In order to monitor and manage these massive crowds, organisers came upon the idea of creating a ‘Social Media Command Center’, and hired a team from communications company Raidious to 
handle it"
" Working out of an office in the city centre, a big team of strategists, data analysts and 
volunteers monitored social media conversations for two weeks before and during the event"
" Their motto was ‘monitor, moderate, publish’"
" 
The command centre monitored around 300 keywords from Facebook, Foursquare, YouTube and 
a series of Twitter hashtags"
" They responded, gathered data, and kept track of sentiment and 
congestion, reaching about 49 000 people in the area"
" Through retweets and shares, they reached 
around 1 million impressions a day"
" In total, that translates to about $3"
2 million in marketing value
"
The team focused on responding to fans who needed advice or help while attending the event"
" For 
example, they sent out links to parking information to drivers stuck without a spot"

Social media is a vital strategic consideration for any brand"
" Whether your organisation is actively involved in social media or not, your consumers are"
" If nothing else, this means that there is 
market data available to you, if you just take a little time to find it"
" 
Organisations that make a considered move in the social media sphere will find it both challenging 
and rewarding"
" The rapid feedback loop can often change preconceptions or even marketing plans, 
as the voice of the customer is amplified through social media"

"1 Introduction 
 
At its core, email marketing is a tool for customer relationship management 
(CRM)"
" Used effectively, this extension of permission-based marketing can deliver 
one of the highest returns on investment (ROI) of any digital marketing activity"
" 
Simply put, email marketing is a form of direct marketing that uses electronic 
means to deliver commercial messages to an audience"
 It is one of the oldest and yet most powerful of all digital marketing tactics
" The power comes from the fact 
that it is:
• Extremely cost effective due to a low cost per contact
• Highly targeted
• Customisable on a mass scale
• Completely measurable
 
Furthermore, email marketing’s main strength is that it takes advantage of 
a customer’s most prolific touchpoint with the Internet – their inbox"
" Many of 
the principles covered in this chapter can be applied to any type of permission 
marketing – especially SMS communication via mobile phones"
"
Email marketing is a tool for building relationships with both existing and potential 
customers"
" It should maximise the retention and value of these customers, which 
should ultimately lead to a greater return on investment"
" Email is being used not 
only to drive retention, but also for acquisition, mobile strategies, and even social media"
"
 
In this chapter, you will learn:
• The basics of email strategy
• How to structure and design an effective marketing email
• How to plan and execute a successful email marketing campaign
• Techniques for measuring and optimising your email campaigns

sending more than 50 emails at a time"
" Most ESPs are do-it-yourself services that do not manage or strategise your campaign, but will give you the tools you need to manage it yourself"
" 
There are some important questions to ask when choosing an email service provider"
"
• How easy is it to use? This is important if you are managing the 
campaigns yourself"
"
• Can you upload and migrate the contact list? It’s important that you own your lists"
"
• Is the process self-service or managed?
• How does the reporting work?• What is their deliverability like? 
• Are they endorsed by email and deliverability authorities, such as 
ReturnPath or Trust-e? 
• Do they adhere to best practices for direct marketing?
• How is the data stored, processed and secured? Who owns it?

"2 Email for mobile phones
 
With the adoption rate of smartphones increasing, more and more people are 
viewing their emails on mobile phones"
" As of January 2013, 42% of emails opened 
are accessed on mobile devices (Litmus, 2013)"
"
This is a challenge"
" The mobile screen is obviously much smaller than a desktop 
screen, and so the way an email is displayed differs vastly as well"
" Not only that, 
but different mobile devices also make use of different mobile operating systems, meaning that each one has different standards and default settings and, as such, 
also renders emails in a unique way"
"
To make things even more difficult, very few people view an email on only one 
device"
" They switch from their smartphone to their laptop to their tablet and 
back to their mobile phone during the course of a day"
" This means that, although sending two versions of your email is an option (one for mobile, one for desktops), 
it’s probably not the best solution"
" You want an email that displays well across as 
many different clients and operating systems as possible"
 One way to achieve this is through responsive email design
"

"438 439Some smartphones do render HTML emails and even auto-fit them to fit the 
mobile screen, but not all handsets do this"
"  
The most important things to keep in mind when designing an email for mobile are:
• The screen is a lot smaller
• Inputs can vary, with touchscreens being the most common
So, your content must be easy to skim, with clear Calls to Action"
"Here are some common best practices to follow when designing your emails, to 
ensure optimal rendering on mobile devices:
• Generally, most emails are designed to be 600px wide to display well in 
an email preview pane – and this scales well on typical mobile screen sizes"
" On a 320px screen, an email can be zoomed out to 50% and display perfectly; similarly, on a 480px screen it can display at 75%"
" 
• Host your email newsletters online and link to them from your preheader"
" That way, anyone who opens your email on a mobile – even those whose mobile phones display emails in plain text – can click straight through to an HTML version of your newsletter"
"
• Design your email in a grid system"
" This means your content needs to be laid out in vertically and horizontally aligned blocks, with gaps in between"
 Doing this will make it easier for various operating systems and email clients to scale your email down to fit a mobile screen
" This is not a guarantee that the email will display properly in mobile, but it should solve the problem for most mobile devices (such as iPhone and 
BlackBerry) which auto-fit HTML emails"
"
• Make sure that you include alt text for your images! Your email needs to 
convey its message with or without images"
"
• Mobile devices that don’t automatically scale your email down will 
display the content on the left of your email first"
" Make sure that your 
most important content is placed here"
"
• Button links need to be at least 44px to render well on mobile phones"
"
Something important to remember: design for touch"
"
Many mobile devices have touchscreens"
" This means that, instead of clicking on 
your links with a mouse, users will be tapping at your links with their fingers"
" If your links are placed too close together, it will be difficult for users to click on 
one link without accidentally also tapping the other"
" To make the user experience 
easier, make sure your links are placed in a 30–45px area, with a margin of at least 15px around them"
" By spacing links like this, it will be easier for touchscreen users 
to follow through on your Call to Action"

"3 Rules and regulations
 
There are a number of laws across the world to protect people from unsolicited 
emails and stop businesses from abusing this communication channel"
" While 
they vary in severity according to the country (and we recommend that you do 
some research into your local legislation), it’s important to acknowledge one very important rule"
" If someone requests to be unsubscribed from your communication, you have to meet their request or face penalties in many jurisdictions"

"1 Growing a database
 
Running a successful email campaign requires a business to have a genuine opt-in database"
" This database – the list of subscribers who have agreed to allow a 
company to send them emails with marketing messages – is the most valuable 
asset of an email campaign"
"
Permission must be explicitly given by all people to whom emails are sent"
" 
Companies that abuse this can put their reputation in jeopardy, and in many countries, legal action can be taken against companies that send unsolicited bulk 
email – also known as spam"
"
It is important to track the permissions that are generated for each user – a time 
stamp is a key part of the data capture and opt-in process and helps to protect you 
against spam complaints and potential legal action"
" 
Spam is unsolicited bulk email – it means that the recipient has not given 
permission to be sent that email"
 It is said to account for 72
"1% of all email 
 
(Lab, 2013)"
"

 Almost three quarters of all email is spam

"440 441The database need have only one entry – the prospect’s email – but the following 
should also be considered:
• Name, surname and title
• Date permission granted
• Source of permission
• Gender
• Country
• Telephone number, preferably mobile
• Date of birth
• Frequency (how often they’d like to hear from you)
 
Fields such as name, surname and title should be separated in your database"
" You should also gather date of birth as opposed to a prospect’s age – it ensures that 
your database can stay up to date"
"
However, don’t be tempted to ask for more information than required"
" The more 
information a marketer can gather, the better he or she can customise marketing messages"
" However, the more information a prospect is required to give, the less likely they are to sign up"
 Further information can be requested over time
"
There are a myriad of ways to attract prospects to opt in to a database"
" An email 
sign-up form on a company website is vital"
" Visitors to a website have already 
expressed an interest in a company by clicking through – this is an opportunity to 
develop that interest further"
" Following the same principle, any other properties where newsletter sign-up can be promoted should be taken advantage of"
" Consider a sign-up form on your company blog, email signatures, Facebook page, and mobi 
site, or perhaps mention it during presentations you deliver"
" And don’t forget other 
offline marketing channels that you’re already using, such as flyers, posters or in-store displays"

"2 Designing an email
 
Emails should be created and viewed as HTML for desktop and most mobile devices"
 Simpler phones require basic text emails
" 
Text emails are the small, plain ones – text only, as the name suggests"
" If you use 
a Windows operating system, and you open Notepad and type there, you will be 
creating a text file"
" As these are text only, the copy really counts here"
" 
HTML emails are the emails with more complex design"
" These emails can contain 
images, different fonts and hyperlinks"
 It’s probably what you’ve had in mind throughout this chapter when we referred to email marketing
"
Given that HTML emails are likely to take longer to download and use up more 
bandwidth, you should give your subscribers the choice of how they would like to 
view your email – in plain text or HTML"
"
Email Marketing  ›  Step-by-step process Email Marketing  ›  Step-by-step process
NOTE
As always, the best 
long-term strategy for 
growing your database 
is to create valuable, 
shareable content that 
people want to read"
""
"442 443Parts of an email
 
Sender information
This includes the ‘to’, ‘from’ and ‘reply to’ fields"
" These are opportunities to build a 
relationship through creating a perception of familiarity"
" In other words, the reader needs to perceive that the newsletter is somewhat unique and sent personally by the publisher"
" Using a personalised company email address (for example, 
trevor@company"
"com) for the ‘reply’ field creates familiarity and builds trust with 
the reader"
 The ‘from’ address should also include the organisation’s name
 A meaningless ‘from’ address that the reader cannot identify serves only to confuse the origin of the newsletter
"
Subject line
The subject line may be the most important part of an email! Subject lines help 
the reader to identify the email and entice them to open it"
" The subject line is also scrutinised by spam filters, and so you should avoid using characters, for example, ‘#2$%&^^%###’ or ‘!!!!!’"
" Consistent subject lines, using the name of 
the company and the newsletter edition, can build familiarity and help readers to sort their inbox"
 Subject lines should also reflect the content of the email
" As with everything online, testing different subject lines will lead marketers to the formula 
that works for them"
" 
Figure 6"
 Sender information and a subject line on an email
"
Preheader
The preheader is a line or two of text displayed above your email header"
" Most 
commonly, it’s the line of text that will redirect you to ‘View online’"
" With more and more people viewing emails on mobile phones, the preheader is also the ideal 
space in which to redirect to the mobile version of your email"
" Where possible, 
try including your Call to Action in the preheader"
" This could be difficult, given the limited space – but it does ensure that every recipient (even those who don’t 
necessarily open the email, but who view only the preheader within the preview 
pane or inbox) will still be exposed to it"
"
Figure 7"
 An email preheader 
"Header
The header is the colourful banner or image that is included in many emails"
" This 
often contains the logo, which is important for branding, as well as a CTA or image 
to catch the recipient’s attention"
" Not every email will have a header, but these do provide added impact"
"
Figure 8"
 An email header 
"
Personalised greeting
With a database that has the capability to store readers’ names, it is possible 
to personalise the greeting of the email"
" “Hi, Kim Morgan” can elicit far better 
responses than “Dear Valued Customer”, but it is possible to create a greeting with personality without personalising it"
" Occasionally, the subject line can be personalised as well to boost responses"
"
Figure 9"

"
Body
This is where the content of the email goes"
" Don’t be tempted to use too many 
images; they can increase the size of the email, and obscure text when images do 
not load"
" Be sure that text is not on the image, but instead can be read without an 
image being loaded"
 The structure must allow readers to scan and navigate the email easily
" Short paragraphs, emphasis through bolding and colours, as well as 
sectioning information with bullets and borders, all contribute to a well-structured 
email"
"
Footer
A standard footer for emails helps to build consistency, and is the customary place 
to keep the contact details of the company sending the email"
" At the very least, this should include the name, physical address and contact email of the company"
" 
It can also include the privacy policy of the sender"
" One way to grow the email list 
is to add a ‘forward to a friend’ link in the footer"

sharing buttons and links in the footer, allowing subscribers to share your email 
on their social networks"
" 
Figure 10"

"
Unsubscribe link
In many countries, it is mandatory to have an unsubscribe link on all commercial 
emails"
" In best practice terms, you should also include a link for managing subscription preferences – this lets the receiver decide exactly which emails they receive from you, rather than opting them out from all of your email marketing"
"
Working with templates
An email template is a predesigned structure you can use for each email you send – you just need to slot content into the appropriate sections"
" Some email service 
providers offer ready-made templates for you to use"
" As with website templates, 
paid-for email templates come with some benefits and disadvantages"
" While they 
are often cheaper than commissioning a custom template, they can be inflexible 
and generic, meaning that they will not uniquely represent your brand"
" If you are choosing a template to buy, consider picking the plainest one, so that you can adapt it to your brand as needed"
" 
A custom-designed email template will allow you to plan your own content 
structure and ensure it displays well across many email readers and devices"
" 
When having your template designed, it’s important to test it with a number of 
email readers, browsers and mobile devices so that you can ensure that it displays 
correctly"
" Given that many people choose to look at an email in their preview pane, this can become more challenging"
"
Design considerations 
How an email looks is integral to how well it is received by your database"
" Design also refers to how it is built, which can impact on whether the email is delivered 
and on how likely users are to interact with it"
" Some design considerations are 
included below"
" A few of these are a little more technical, so make sure that your email partner has these covered for you"
"
The look and feel
Studies have found that users read or scan emails following an F-shape (Nielsen, 
2006)"
" So, plan your important information to follow this flow"
Figure 11
" Online, people tend to read in an F-shape"
" (Source: Nielsen, 2006)
Cluttered inboxes and busy subscribers mean an email that’s lengthy and difficult 
to get through probably won’t be read"
" Help your subscribers by structuring your 
email content into segments, making use of borders or colour blocks to accentuate and divide content"
 It’s important to balance image and text in your emails
" Make a 
point of placing images next to the relevant text"
"
General design guidelines
HTML and CSS design principles differ for web and email"
" Here are a few things to 
keep in mind when designing your email:
• Don’t make use of external or embedded style sheets and avoid 
unnecessary embedded rows and columns"
"
• Make use of table nesting as far as possible, as this is generally considered to render the best results with difficult email clients"
" Email 
designers tend to make use of tables to design their email layout, using 
inline styles within these tables"
" 
• Set a fixed width for your email by specifying the width and spacing 
of each cell rather than the entire table"
" When these specifics are not 
declared, email clients tend to render the email according to their own defaults and can break the design"
"
• If you are using a block background colour, be sure to include a 100% width table to cover the entire email"
" 
• Keep fonts in your email design larger than 9px"
 Anything below that becomes difficult to view in some email clients
" Also bear in mind that, while coloured text (or light-on-dark text) may look visually impressive, it can be difficult to read an entire email like this and may strain your subscribers’ eyes"
" Rather limit such visual tricks to smaller sections of 
your email, or to emails that contain less written content"
"
• Make use of inline CSS – some email clients strip the CSS from the head 
and body of the email"
"
• Test your emails in a variety of email clients before you send"

"446 447Designing for the preview pane
Many email users use desktop clients to manage their email"
" Given the number of 
emails people receive on a daily basis, many do not open emails but prefer to view 
them in their preview panes"
" This has added another challenge for designers who 
want to ensure that their emails display properly"
" 
Images and layout should consider the preview pane and be tested for rendering"
" 
Preview panes can be vertical or horizontal"
"
Tips for designing for the preview pane:
• There is no set width, and we reiterate that testing is the way to go"
" A 
width of 600px works best for preview pane display"
" 
• Preview panes favour the top left-hand side of an email"
" While each preview pane may vary according to client or user settings, the most commonly favoured preview pane dimensions cover the area in the top 
300–500px of your email (Hamilton, 2012)"
" Given the width of 600 pixels, 
you’re then (generally speaking) looking at the top 600px x 300px of your email as being most likely to be displayed in a preview pane"
"
• Ensure that plain, email-friendly fonts are used toward the top of your email in order to ensure that the first text encountered is properly displayed"
"
• Consider carefully what images you display in the top section of your email, and test display accordingly"
" 
• Placing your logo prominently in the top left of your email can ensure optimal brand recognition and exposure"
"
• Try to include your Call to Action in the area displayed in the preview 
pane"
" That way, even if subscribers choose not to read your email, 
they’ll still see your primary message"
"
• Some successful email templates use the area likely to be seen in the preview pane to provide a table of contents for the email"
 Users know what they can look forward to when opening the email
"
 
Email and images
Avoid using images to convey important content"
" Make sure that there is alt text 
for all images used in the email"
" This ensures that the message of the image will 
still be communicated even if the image itself is not seen"
" Remember, many email 
clients are set by default not to display images"
 Your email should make sense whether or not the user enables images
"Tips for using images in email design:
• In the past, background images did not render well in emails, but this is changing"
" A block background colour tends to display well across most 
email clients"
"
• When including images in your HTML, be sure to declare the height and 
width for each image to ensure consistent rendering across most email clients"
"
Emails that make sense without images, and render correctly across all platforms, are more likely to persuade a reader to load the images (and open the email), as 
well as click through to the website"
"
Figure 12"
 Good use of clear image alt tags in an email newsletter 
"
The Call to Action
Email design should support the Calls to Action"
" In order for your campaign to 
be effective, your goals and KPIs should be supported by the email layout and 
design"
" Calls to Action can be hyperlinked text (also called text links), or can be 
images which look like buttons"
" Don’t forget though, that if images are blocked, your buttons will be blocked too"
"
Generally, both text links and CTA buttons are effective for generating clickthroughs"
" 
While you should use buttons for links that support your CTA (for example, ‘make 
a booking’, ‘check availability’), your email shouldn’t be littered with them, and 
hyperlinks should be used for additional links"
 The best thing to do is test them to see what kinds of CTAs perform best for you
"
The copy of the CTA is exceptionally important: a well-crafted and enticingly 
written CTA makes a big difference to the performance of your campaign"
" Again, 
test variations to determine what drives the highest clickthrough and conversion 
rates on your campaigns"
"

"3 Creating content
 
Email content that is relevant and valuable to readers is vital to ensuring the success 
of an email marketing campaign"
" Valuable content is informative and should 
address the problems and needs of readers"
" It is important to realise that the reader determines the value of the content, not the publisher"
" Newsletters can offer:
• Humour
• Research
• Information
• Promotions
• Exclusive content
 
Determining the content of your email is an important element of your overall brand content strategy"
"
Any copy written for your brand should follow a pre-determined brand voice guide"
" 
Consistency is important and will dictate how your customers trust and build a 
relationship with your brand"
" 
The principles of writing good online copy apply"
" You should start with the most 
important information first, and make sure that your language is scannable (meaning 
that it makes use of the appropriate formatting, such as bolding and bulleted lists)"
"
It may be helpful to review the Writing for Digital chapter at this stage, but there 
are two elements that are important to highlight with respect to writing for email marketing"
"
1"
 The first is in-email links
" It’s important to consider that any links you 
include in your email copy will lead readers away from your email"
" You’ll want to keep these to a minimum, and include a link only when it is a Call to Action, a legal requirement or a service feature"
" 
2"
 The second element is the all-important subject line
" Many users decide 
whether or not to open an email based on their first point of contact – the subject line"
" 
For an email newsletter, it’s useful to put together a recurring content structure"
" 
The example shown here depicts a consistent content structure with repeating 
elements"

"4 Segmenting your database 
 
The technology of email marketing allows for mass customisation – it is one-to-
one marketing on a macro scale"
" Even simple personalisation can see improved 
results"
"
Customisation covers everything from using the recipient’s name, to sending the 
correct email version to their device, to sophisticated measurement of a recipient’s 
preferences and tailoring content to suit them"
"
Segmenting a database can allow for customisation across demographics or 
purchase history"
" For example, you may choose to divide your database according to gender or age"
" A political campaign may benefit from targeting messages to 
different demographics"
" A pet store may find it useful to segment their mailing 
list according to the different kinds of pets their customers own"
" In this way, it is possible to send mailers that are slightly different and tweaked to different target 
groups"
"
16"

"5 Deploying
 
By creating valuable content, establishing the correct frequency and testing the email for display and deliverability, an email marketer should be able to ensure an 
excellent delivery rate"
 Consistency in deploying newsletters also aids in fostering trust and fulfilling expectations
" When should you send emails? Common sense tells you not on Monday morning or Friday afternoon, but this varies by audience"
 Testing will guide you
" Generally speaking, the best days of the week to send emails are between Tuesday and 
Thursday"
"
Email reputation
Email reputation is a score given to you depending on how well your emails are 
regarded by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and your subscribers"
" If the sender’s 
score falls within the ISP’s thresholds, a sender’s messages will be delivered"
" If 
not, the sender’s emails may arrive in the bulk or spam folder, be quarantined, or be bounced back to the sender"
"
How it works: There are various authentication systems that can impact your 
reputation score"
" One of these is the Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and 
Domain Name System (DNS)"
" DKIM associates domain names with individual 
email addresses, ensuring that each organisation has to take responsibility for emails sent that are associated with their domain"
" Basically, DKIM signs out any outbound emails"
" The DKIM signature is added to the email header 
and includes an encrypted code"
" The receiving mail server will then take that 
DKIM signature and verify it with the DNS system to find the matching DKIM public key"
" Once it has this key, it can use it to unlock the encrypted code – if 
the code hasn’t been changed, the email hasn’t been tampered with, which 
means it can be authenticated and passed into the receiving mail server"
"
Becoming an effective email marketer requires constant list cleansing and hygiene"
" In fact, most lists shrink by 30% each year as a result of subscribers 
changing email addresses"
" Build a preference centre and send out an email once 
a year asking subscribers to update their details"
 Make sure you are diligent about maintaining a current opt-in list to achieve maximum deliverability via reputation
"
Tips to help your reputation score:
• ISPs offer various authentication standards such as Sender ID, Sender 
policy framework (SPF), and DomainKeys"
 Quirk highly recommends the use of these standards
"
• Remember that a huge but inaccurate and outdated database is far less useful to an email marketer than a tightly maintained, smaller database"
" Strive to boost your database, but don’t forget to clean as you go"
" 
• Ensure that email broadcast rates are not too high"
"
• Respond to complaints and unsubscribe requests – if someone requests to be unsubscribed, do so"
" If you don’t, there’s a good chance you’ll face stiff penalties"
"
• Educate users about white lists"

"6 Measuring
 
As with all things digital marketing, tracking, analysing and optimising are key to 
growth and success"
" Email tracking systems produce statistics in a user-friendly 
manner"
"
Key measurables for understanding the performance of email campaigns include:
• Number of emails delivered"
"
• Number of bounces (this should be separated into hard bounces and soft 
bounces)"
"
• Number of unique emails opened: an email can be delivered, but not opened"
"
• Unsubscribes: significant or consistent loss in subscribers is a key indication you are not meeting the needs of your subscribers"
"
• Pass-on rate: a high pass-on rate (forwards) indicates that your 
customers value the content enough to share it constantly with others"
 Putting an easy ‘forward to a friend’ link in every email can increase this
 You’ll want to measure this link specifically
" Adding a sign-up link to 
forwarded emails will organically grow the opt-in list"
"
• Clickthrough rates and conversion: These measure the effectiveness of 
an email via the links placed in the content"
" When a reader clicks through 
to a web page, these can be easily measured as a percentage against the 
number of delivered, opened or sent emails"
" It reveals which content or 
promotion was the most enticing for the reader"
Some metrics are more useful than others
 A good example of this is the open rate
" Emails are tracked using an image that gets downloaded, but many email 
desktop clients block the downloading of images"
" This means that people may be 
reading a text-only version of your email"
" 
What you should be interested in is what activity takes place based on an email"
" 
So you’ll need to track leads or actions"
 You can do this through link tagging (appending tracking parameters to a URL in your newsletter)
" These parameters 
are then identified by the Google Analytics of your website, registering that the 
user has come to the site through your email"
" Google Analytics will then take the information in the tag and store it in a cookie, from which it can track the user’s interactions with the site after they arrived at the landing page"
"
Here is a link to the Quirk website as it may appear in a Quirk email campaign:

quirk
"biz/?utm_source=dec01&utm_medium=email&utm_
campaign=digital marketing2013
The tracking parameters are:?utm_source=dec01&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=digital marketing2013
These can then be used to report on traffic from that email using Google Analytics"
"Generic email benchmarks can be used as a guide to see how well your campaigns 
are performing, but the best way to monitor performance is to benchmark your own campaign"
"
Smaller lists tend to have a higher open rate, but this is probably because 
they’re more targeted"
 The overall average open rate is 11
"2%, while the overall 
clickthrough rate is 1"
6%
" Overall rates are quite low because far too many 
ignorant or lazy email marketers bring down the average"
" It’s best to look at the average open rate for your industry, rather than the overall rates"
" You can do this by checking the Email Stat Centre website (EmailStatCenter, n"
d
)
"
Once the reports have been generated, it is time to work out what the numbers are 
revealing, and then use this information to improve the next email sent out"
"

"7 Testing
 
In order to make sure that your email marketing efforts are continually improving, it’s important to test your campaigns"
"
The most common form of email testing is to conduct an A/B split test"
" This is a 
test that involves sending one version of your newsletter to a specified percentage Email Marketing  ›  Step-by-step process Email Marketing  ›  Step-by-step process

database"
" Some factors to test include:
• Open rates across different subject lines and delivery times"
"
• Optimal number of links in an email for clickthrough rates and 
conversions"
"
• Different copy styles and copy length"
"
• The effect of video on delivery rates, open rates and conversions"
"
• Balance of text and image ratio"
"
By monitoring the results of each send, you can determine which version yielded 
the desired results"
" You can, for instance, test variations of your subject line to determine which is more effective in persuading subscribers to open your email"
"
Examples of what to test:
• Subject lines
• Send times
• Best day to send
• Layout
• Text vs"
" button links
• Database segmentation
• Call to Action
Testing and monitoring your send statistics go hand in hand"
" It’s important to 
analyse your results after sending to ensure you’re implementing the most 
effective strategies for your database"

"6 Advantages and challenges
 
Permission-based email marketing can give the highest return on investment of any marketing activities"
" Technology allows mass customisation, allowing 
personalisation across a large list of subscribers"
"
When used to foster relationships with a customer base, email marketing can go a 
long way to increasing the lifetime value of that customer"
"
Email marketing is highly measurable, and databases are able to be easily and 
thoroughly segmented"
"
However, with the increasing numbers of companies and individuals using email 
marketing, many consumers are email fatigued"
" It requires ingenuity, focus and dedication to maintain an email database and consistently deliver useful quality 
emails that will be read"
"
It does not take much for email to be marked as spam, and it can be difficult to 
recover from being branded as a spammer by the ISPs"

"1 One-line summary
Zando achieves a 78% open rate by implementing email marketing best practices"
"
16"
7
"2 The problem
Zando is a South African online fashion store that sells a wide range of clothes, shoes and 
accessories around the country"
" In an effort to increase their database of customers, Zando considered running an email-based marketing campaign"
"
Zando approached Digital Fire, a digital marketing agency, to assist them with their email 
campaign"
" Zando wanted to create brand awareness, target new customers, grow their existing email database with quality leads, and increase traffic to their website in an effort to boost sales"
" Ideal new customers who fitted into their target market would need to be high-earning female 
South African urbanites (Digital Fire, 2012)"
"
16"
7
"3 The solution
To meet these business objectives, Digital Fire created an email campaign with an enticing Call 
to Action at its core"
" Readers were offered the chance for them and a friend to “win a new pair of 
shoes every month for a year” (Digital Fire, 2012)"
"
Figure 15"
 The Zando email newsletter 
"
The campaign profiled and tracked user actions, and allowed readers to pass the email on to their 
friends easily"
" The Call to Action ‘click here to enter’ prompted readers to fill in their own details, 
and those of a friend, for the Zando database (Digital Fire, 2012)"
" 
The email was sent to 70 000 people in Zando’s target market from a well-maintained opt-in email 
database, with a second follow-up email sent later (Digital Fire, 2012)"
"
16"
7
"4 The results
An impressive 29% of people who received the first email opened it, with 11 800 people entering the competition with their personal details and signing up to the Zando email newsletter (Digital 
Fire, 2012)"
" This is a great result considering that traditionally direct mail has a response rate of 
around 0"
1%
"
The follow-up email was sent to competition entrants, thanking them for entering the competition 
and encouraging them to have a look at the Zando website"
" An astonishing 78% of these recipients 
clicked though, which resulted in more than 5 000 new visits to the Zando (Digital Fire, 2012)"
" 
Key elements that contributed to the campaign’s success were: 
• A well-managed and filtered email contact database
• Striking design
• Effective copy
• A strong Call to Action
• An enticing incentive 
• The entering mechanism where the reader and a friend’s details were requested
The viral sharing element particularly contributed to the campaign’s success (Digital Fire, 2012)"
" 
16"
"8 The bigger picture
 
While email marketing can operate as a stand-alone marketing campaign, integrating it with 
other channels, both online and offline, will serve to reinforce the brand’s message and increase 
responses"
"
There should never be a disparity between the content, tone or design of an email when compared 
to the rest of a company’s offerings"
" In-store promotions can be reinforced and promoted to an email database, or website information can be summarised for email"
Email Marketing  ›  The bigger picture Email Marketing  ›  Case study – Zando
"458 459Custom landing pages, if required, should be created for any promotions being communicated by 
email"
" For the most part, marketing emails should aim to get the customer to the site; landing 
pages are therefore essential"
 They need to be optimised to close the Call to Action
" So the email 
gets the subscriber onto the page and the landing page gets them to sign up, buy, or engage"
 The idea is to create a flow between the two that brings the ‘selling’ process full circle – whether it’s actually buying something or just reading through the content to engage them with the brand
"
Email marketing and social media work very well together for cross-channel promotion"
" Where 
email can create a one-on-one feel between a brand and an individual, social media can move that 
attention towards a sense of community and keep your reader involved in a dialogue"
" 
16"
"9 Summary
 
Email marketing is a form of direct marketing that can deliver the best ROI of any digital marketing tactic"
" It is:
• Highly targeted and customisable
• Cost effective
• Easy to set up, test and track
Gaining explicit permission to send email marketing to a person is a prerequisite for successful email marketing"
" Once you have this permission, all emails sent by an organisation and the 
individuals in that organisation can be seen as marketing opportunities"
"
Successful email marketing requires careful planning and testing"
" HTML emails need to be tested 
across a range of email clients, and should be tested for a spam score, before being deployed"
"
All email sent to a list of subscribers needs to provide an easy and accessible unsubscribe link in 
the email"
 Make sure you adhere to your local regulations for email marketing

"1 Introduction 
The mobile web is ubiquitous; six out of every seven people in the world use a 
mobile phone – that’s six billion people (Wang, 2013)"
" More people are active on 
Facebook through mobile devices than desktop (Tam, 2013); comScore research 
shows that Americans spent 225"

" 
The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) defines mobile marketing as “a set 
of practices that enables organisations to communicate and engage with their 
audience in an interactive and relevant manner through any mobile device or network” (Mobile Marketing Association, 2013)"
" 
Mobile devices are important to consider in any marketing strategy, and this 
chapter looks at the ways in which we can use mobile as part of an engagement 
strategy"
" 
Mobile engagement extends far beyond just the mobile phone, or just SMS 
marketing"
 It’s a mindset rather than a specific tactic
" It’s all about context – 
reaching people at exactly the right time, place and mood to facilitate their needs, provide a convenient touchpoint and encourage them to convert"
" 
It’s important to note that mobile marketing is very different in the developed 
world – where smartphones dominate, delivering rich web and application user 
experiences – and the developing world – where many phones are still text based, 
have crude WAP browsers, and radio, USSD and SMS are the most prolific services"
" Mobile users have a hierarchy of needs, which are fulfilled to various degrees by 
the capabilities of their devices:
Figure 1"
" The mobile hierarchy of needs, devised by the Quirk Think team"
"At the foundation, people use mobile devices to communicate – by voice, text or 
web access"
" Belonging addresses the need to be social and to form communities, using tools such as mobile social networks"
" Further up, mobile devices allow a great degree of on-the-go convenience, such as online shopping, research, mobile 
banking, career listings, coupons, and more – these more advanced capabilities 
are not available on very basic mobile devices"
 Education and information gathering also fit in here
" Finally, mobile phones can entertain through games, apps and rich 
media"
" 
Understanding where your target market falls on this scale will allow you to 
communicate more effectively with them, using the correct mobile channels and 
approaches"
"

• Why mobile is the most important communication channel available to 
marketers today
• A variety of mobile messaging channels and applications, from simple SMS messaging to advanced mobile commerce

always-on, always nearby nature"
" As mobile devices offer constant access and 
communication to users, they add a layer of interaction to existing real-world 
relationships"
"

"1 Six unique features of mobile
 
Tomi Ahonen, an expert in mobile communications, has laid out six features that are unique to mobile and act as a framework for understanding mobile 
communications (Ahonen, 2008)"
" These features affect the way we create and view 
mobile content"
1
 Mobile devices are personal
"
While most computers do present a personal connection to the Internet, they are not as personal as mobile devices"
" Mobile phones are part of people’s personal 
presentation and their social affiliations"
" 
The implication for marketers: Respect for privacy and permission is important in 
all aspects of marketing, particularly when it comes to mobile"
"
2"
 Mobile devices are always carried
"
Consider your own behaviour: what do you take with you when you leave your 
house – wallet, keys and mobile phone? 
The implication for marketers: Messages sent to mobile devices will most likely be 
accessed within minutes of being received"
" Messages sent to recipients can be 
read and acted on immediately"
" 
3"
 Mobile devices are always on
"
In order to fulfil its primary function – as a communication tool – the mobile device 
is always on"
" 
The implication for marketers: Marketers need to be even more sensitive with their 
marketing communications"
" Not many people would appreciate an SMS at 4am 
informing them of a special offer"
"
4"
 Mobile devices have a built-in payment system
"
All mobile phones (and many other mobile devices) have a built-in payment 
mechanism – the SIM card"
" Billing is easily handled through the user’s mobile 
network"
" On top of that, paying for content and downloads has been built into the 
way that consumers use their devices"
"
The implication for marketers: Consumers are willing to pay for services and content 
on their mobile devices"
 Advertising is not the only way to generate revenue for content
"
5"
 Mobile devices are available at the point of creative inspiration
"
The mobile device features a number of tools that let users act on creative impulse, from taking photos and videos to becoming a scribbling pad on which to jot down 
ideas"
" Tools like Instagram, Evernote and Snapchat are purpose built for creating, 
sharing and consuming creative content"
"
The implication for marketers: This feature can be used to encourage interactivity 
within campaigns created for mobile"
" It presents the mobile device as a useful Mobile Marketing  ›  The role of mobile in personal communication Mobile Marketing  ›  Key terms and concepts

" The flipside is that 
people can also post negative brand messages in the heat of the moment if they 
have a bad experience; online monitoring and CRM should be considered here for 
managing any potential backlash"
" 
6"
 Mobile devices allow accurate audience measurement
"
Every transaction made on a mobile device can be uniquely tracked, whether the transaction is a voice call, an SMS message or access to the Internet"
" They also 
allow for real-time tracking, where campaigns can be tweaked as they are run, and 
for location-based tracking, where customers receive marketing messages base on where they are physically located"
" 
The implication for marketers: Aggregated data provides profiling and segmenting 
opportunities for targeting the right audience"
" Campaigns can also be accurately 
measured and tracked for their return on investment (ROI)"
" As always, make sure 
you are respecting your customers’ privacy and obtaining their consent"

"2 Mobile devices: An overview
Mobile devices span beyond just mobile phones"
" While we focus on mobile phones in this chapter, since those are the most prevalent, it’s important to acknowledge 
that mobile devices include portable game consoles, media players, global 
positioning systems and tablets"
"
Figure 2"
 ‘Mobile’ includes many different mobile devices
"Of course, many people own more than one mobile device, or use it in connection 
with various other devices"
 This phenomenon of multiscreen usage is very important for marketers to understand
" Here are some common scenarios:
• People often browse eCommerce websites using their mobile device, but then make the final purchasing decision at a desktop computer"
" 
• Similarly, customers may use their mobile devices in physical retail outlets to scan, compare and research items, making their purchase later once they’ve had the chance to research in more detail"
"
• Commonly, people use a mobile device like a smartphone or a tablet 
while watching TV, simultaneously engaging with two screens and 
streams of content at once"
" 
By understanding how your audience uses their devices in combination, or at different stages of the sales process, you can improve your CRM, marketing and analytics processes"
"
Mobile network standards
When it comes to mobile, there tend to be lots of confusing acronyms and 
technical terms to understand; as a marketer, however, it’s not vital to 
understand all the nitty gritty details"
" To keep things simple, mobile network standards are the technologies used to connect a mobile device to the mobile 
network"
" There are three main ones you should know:
• GSM is the most widespread global network standard and is found across Europe, Africa, and most other parts of the world
• CDMA is predominantly found in the US, Canada and some Asian countries
• LTE is an upcoming, upgraded and faster version of GSM

"4 Mobile messaging channels
 
There are many features built into the mobile phone that can form a part of your 
marketing campaigns"

"1 SMS
Short Message Service (SMS) is the largest data application on the planet"
" By the end of 2013, mobile users will be sending 19"
"5 billion SMSs per day (Clark-Dickson, 
2013)"
" It is also one of the simplest and most effective mobile marketing channels 
available"
" Interestingly, SMS messages were initially designed as a way for network engineers to conduct tests on mobile networks, and not for commercial use at all"

""
"468 469SMS messages can be a maximum of 160 characters long, although it is possible 
to string several together in order to send longer messages (this is called 
concatenating)"
" Messages can be sent from one phone to another or from a 
desktop computer to a phone and vice versa"
"
Almost all mobile phones support SMS"
" The restriction on the amount of data that 
can be communicated through SMS demands simplicity, and so consideration must be given to working creatively within the space of the small screen"
" 
SMS has useful marketing applications"
" It enables two-way communication, which 
allows subscribers to activate services and cheaply access important information"
" 
However, abusing this type of communication can also be problematic"
" The mobile 
phone is a highly personal device, and the potential to invade a mobile user’s personal space is much greater"
" 
SMS and marketing
With the massive volume of SMS messages being sent every day, SMS marketing must be considered by marketers"
" However, mobile phone users have proved 
reluctant to hand over their phone numbers for marketing messages, perhaps 
fearing a similar deluge of spam to the one they receive in their email inboxes"
" 
This is changing to some extent, with the prevalence of Common Short Codes 
(CSC) in marketing"
" CSCs are short codes used in text messages, usually to get 
something in return, such as a competition entry"
" These can be sent to and from consumers, and often use keywords"
" There are two standard keywords that should 
always elicit a standard response:
• STOP"
 Unsubscribe the sender’s number from the service
"
• HELP"
 A support request from the sender’s number
"
Figure 3"
 A Common Short Code on a competition entry from Spark ATM
"As consumers are comfortable with using text messages for their communication, 
no extensive education process is required to have consumers access marketing campaigns based on CSCs"
"
There are several ways that SMS messages can be used to complement an existing 
marketing strategy"
"
Customer relationship management
SMS updates can be an exceptionally useful tool for customer relationship 
management (CRM)"
" In the travel industry, hotel and airplane reservations can be 
sent by mobile phone, with updates being sent close to the time of travel"
" These 
short messages can include directions or details of a flight’s status"
" When it comes to insurance claims or order processing, SMS updates on the progress of a claim or order can reduce call centre volumes and go a long way to ensuring that a client 
feels valued"
"
Promotions
SMS messages allow you to send timely sales promotions to a large database 
for a relatively low cost"
 These can be targeted to a particular time of day when prospects are most likely to be out shopping
" 
Receiving messages
CSCs are often used to receive messages from prospects or customers"
" They provide a fast, instant and trackable means for the public to enter competitions, 
voice opinions, or make requests"
" Even better for a company, the costs can often 
be passed on to the consumer, meaning that it can be a cost-effective way to receive marketing messages"
"
Please call me messages
Please call me messages – SMSs that are sent for free, asking the recipient to phone the sender back – are popular across Africa"
" These usually include an 
advert after the message, and this is an excellent position to reach lower-LSM 
users, who are more likely to be sending these messages"
"
17"

"2 MMS
 
Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is the media-rich version of SMS messages, and can contain graphics, audio, video, or images and text"
" These messages allow

to use their phones to create content (photographic, audio or video) and pass on

marketers as it requires the recipient to bear considerable data costs to receive the messages"

"3 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 
 
Apart from cellular network connectivity, most modern mobile devices have the ability to connect via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth"
"
Figure 4"
 The Bluetooth logo
"
If a user sets his or her Bluetooth-enabled mobile device to ‘discoverable’, 
Bluetooth devices within range of the phone can request to connect to it and exchange messages and data"
" This can be used to send location-specific marketing 
messages, such as discount codes in a shopping mall"
"

"4 USSD 
 
Unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) is an alternative messaging 
system to SMS and is available on most mobile data networks"
"
Unlike SMS, USSD is a protocol that allows a query-and-response action between 
the customer and a service centre"
"  USSD services are initiated by the user, who 
enters a code on the device and then sends that as a request to the network"
" The 
code differs from the number to which an SMS is sent because it includes the symbols # and *"
" For example, a code like *100# can be used to check the balance 
of a prepaid airtime account"
" 
These services are often used by networks to provide a service to a customer, such 
as requesting balance information, adding credit to a prepaid contract or passing 
on credit to another mobile phone user"
" Using USSD can also help you build up a profile of your customer, by tracking the kinds of interactions and services they engage in"
" On top of that, USSD can be used to gather data for CRM purposes, and to conduct surveys, in which you can gather specific data about respondents"
" 
USSD also allows users to complete a double opt in, which is required in some 
jurisdictions before you can send marketing messages to a recipient"
Figure 5
 How USSD appears on a phone
"
It is a rudimentary navigation process, but with far faster response times and lower 
costs when compared to SMS or to mobile browsing"
" In lower-income markets 
where web access is not prevalent, USSD can be a very powerful tool for engaging 
mobile users – it has a high success rate, low technological barrier to entry, and a low cost for the marketer"
" 
M-Pesa is a mobile money-transfer service that was created in Kenya in 2007"
" It 
was devised to allow urban workers to send money home to their rural families, 
who had little or no access to banking or postal services, but who owned or could access a mobile phone"
" Since the money is transferred by SMS or USSD, no Internet access is required either"
"
M-Pesa has been so successful in Kenya that is has over 10"
"5 million active 
monthly subscribers, who have transferred over $5"
"9 billion (between October 
2012 and March 2013) through 65,547 registered agents around the country (Safaricom, 2013)"
" 
M-Pesa has been rolled out to countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia"

"5 Instant messaging
 
Instant messaging makes it possible for people to exchange messages in real time"
" 
To users, it offers many of the benefits of SMS, but it is instant and often cheaper"
" 
According to Juniper Research, mobile IM users will exceed 1"
"3 billion globally by 
2016"
" The report also states that the market is fragmented across a wide range of apps and service providers (mobiThinking, 2012)"
"
IM applications are available to users who own smartphones and also on some 
feature phones"

From a marketer’s point of view, IM can offer a channel for customer support, but 
presents even more of a risk in terms of alienating or angering consumers"
 This is a space reserved for personal contacts
" That said, instant support gives you the chance to reach customers when they are focused on your service or product"

relies on the assumption that you are available to provide the information needed 
instantly"

"6 QR codes
 
QR codes, also called 3D barcodes, offer a way to compress complex information into an image that can be decoded by your mobile phone"
" 
QR codes can offer users with camera phones a convenient way to get information 
with just one click"
" Once you have installed a QR code reading app, these barcodes 
can be interpreted by the phone’s camera to provide website URLs, contact 
information, discount vouchers, or even to activate downloads"
" 
Figure 7"

"The image on the left may look like a hybrid between a crossword and a Sudoku 
puzzle, but it’s really the QR code for the URL of the mobile version of the marketing 
blog GottaQuirk, m"
gottaquirk
com
" 
QR codes are a pull technology – they allow users to take the actions they want 
conveniently and quickly"
" They can be useful for sharing product or promotional 
information"
 One of the exciting benefits of QR codes is that they offer a way to activate offline advertising and make it interactive and measurable
" A print 
campaign can, for example, include a barcode that can be used to send a user 
directly to your website"
"
QR codes are especially popular in East Asian countries, where the large prevalence 
of sophisticated smartphones makes accessing and using them easy"
"
However, QR codes do have their issues"
" They can be prone to bugs, and they also 
face a large barrier to entry for most smartphone users (since it is necessary to first install a specialised app before you can scan and use QR codes)"
"

"7 Automated voicemail messages
 
Automated voicemail messaging (AVM) involves creating a pre-recorded voice message that customers can hear if they dial a specific number"
" This is a popular 
option in emerging markets where literacy rates are low"
" It also provides an 
excellent way to capitalise on a celebrity endorsement, since the celebrity can record one message and have it be distributed to callers around the country"
"

"8 Voice technologies
 
These days, mobile phones can also be controlled through voice commands"
" Sophisticated voice-activated applications like Siri on the iPhone allow users to 
perform complex tasks simply by asking a question or requesting an action out 
loud"
" For example, Siri responds to queries like “What is the weather like in Denver?” and “Can you move my 9am meeting to lunch time?” by analysing the key words used and returning the correct information, or completing the task"
" You 
can find out more about Siri here: www"
apple
com/ios/siri
"
There are also less-complex versions of voice-based control, for example in Google 
search, where the user can speak a query rather than typing it (which is beneficial on mobile, considering the typical hassle of typing on a small device)"
"
Another mobile voice technology is interactive voice response (IVR)"
" IVR is used 
in automated telephone systems to navigate through the menus"
" Rather than 
pressing a specific key to select an option, the user simply speaks their choice"
"

Have you ever scanned 
a QR code with your phone? What was the experience like? If not, what is holding you back?"
"474 475Voice technologies are exciting, convenient and easy to use"
" However, there is still 
a relatively high rate of inaccuracy in the technology, leading to misunderstood 
voice inputs and frustrations"
"
17"
"5 Location and mobile
 
Convenience and location are two cornerstones of the mobile marketing world"
" 
If services and useful information can be shared based on a user’s location, the possibilities for conversion naturally increase"
" The more contextually relevant your 
marketing message is to the user, the more likely they are to engage"
"
A survey conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 
74% of smartphone users use their mobile phones to find locations"
" Google 
found that 68% of mobile users visited the business after searching for it on a 
smartphone (Google, 2012)"
" And 67% of users surveyed shared that they would be 
more likely to buy if the website were designed for mobile devices (Google, 2012)"
" 
17"

"1 Geo-location
 
Combining mobile marketing techniques with geo-location can go a long way in 
providing customers with what they need"
" 
There are a few different scenarios possible for implementing location in your 
mobile marketing campaigns"
" Location-targeted search offers some significant 
benefits"
" If searching for a local doctor, for example, it would be immensely useful 
to find the closest one and a map to his or her location in the first listed result"
" Localised news results could also offer a better user experience for someone 
conducting a mobile news search"
" Combining short codes or QR codes with print 
advertising in an area is another way to provide consumers with geo-relevant information"
" A QR code in a store or on a poster could offer a discount voucher to someone coming to the local retail outlet, for example"
"
 
To reach customers in areas of the world where data is scarcer and more expensive, some online services are turning towards a ‘zero rating’ system – 
which means that users don’t pay for data when accessing that particular service"
" 
For example, Facebook launched its Facebook Zero service in Africa to massive 
success"
" Accessing the simple, text-based website was free to all users"
" Just 18 
months after launching, the number of Facebook users in Africa had increased by 114% (Mims, 2012)"
"
When combined with location awareness, mobile search offers a targeted user 
experience"
"If a website can detect what device someone is using and where they are, content 
customised to their location could be delivered, either automatically or after user 
input"
"

"2 Mobile social networks
 
What are mobile social networks? Online social networks have extended their 
presence to mobile phones"
" 
• m"
facebook
"com
• m"
twitter
"com
In addition, there are several social networks created specifically for mobile devices and centred on the potential of location-specific awareness"
 One example is Instagram (instagram
com)
"
One successful example of mobile social networking is Mxit"
" This South African 
company runs a messaging and social networking platform that is popular among 
the South African youth"
 With 7
"5 million monthly active users (McConnachie, 2013), 
Mxit is a cheaper messaging alternative to standard SMS"
" In addition to the chat rooms in which users interact, Mxit offers brands the option to sell multimedia 
downloads and customised skins, and to create branded chat rooms for specific 
competitions or promotions"
 Mxit has its own currency – Moola – which enables purchases via Mxit’s Tradepost commerce system
" This ties in with Toni Ahonen’s important observation about mobile devices having a built-in payment system – 
after all, Moola can be purchased using prepaid airtime and then spent on games, 
images, music tracks and more"
"
Many social media and social networking sites are also adopting and encouraging 
geo-tagging as a way for users to comment on posts"
 Services such as Foursquare (www
foursquare
"com) and Facebook encourage users to ‘check in’ when they 
are at various locations"
 Foursquare also offers a social incentive to check in at locations – the people who visit the most become the ‘Mayor’ and can get cash discounts or vouchers at participating locations
"

Mobile Marketing  ›  Location and mobile Mobile Marketing  ›  Mobile messaging channels
NOTE
Google Free Zone is 
another example of a 
zero-rated service"
" It 
allows people in specific 
countries to access 
Gmail, Google+ and 
Google search on mobile 
without incurring any 
data costs"
""
"476 477Coffee giant Starbucks and clothing brand Gap are two brands that make frequent 
use of Foursquare for deals, limited-time offers and loyalty rewards"
" Have a look at 
their listings here: foursquare"
com/starbucks and foursquare
com/gap
"
Some platforms allow people to tag locations with notes or information, and to let 
their friends or contacts know where they are"
" Some users prefer not to do this, 
but for others, the ability to comment on their daily lives is exciting and connects them with people who may not be physically near them through content"
" 
Mobile social networks can also have operational value, especially from a sales 
and leads perspective"
" As getting work done becomes more important than where 
it is done, communication tools are more and more essential to CRM"
" And mobile 
devices lie at the centre of this"
" 
As the different networks evolve, it is worth considering the potential of social 
search as well"
" Product or brand searches based around social networks and location can be a powerful tool: personal referrals are now combined with location-
specific information"
" 
Because of the prevalence of mobile, there is a strong strategic incentive to 
provide free, fast Wi-Fi networks to customers who visit physical retail outlets, restaurants or shopping centres"
" Not only does this provide a great selling point, 
it also gives the marketer a channel to communicate with and gain information 
from customers"
" For example, this lets you track their mobile behaviour and location (with permission, of course), send coupons and offers, engage in CRM-related questionnaires, provide helpful information and support, and more"
"

"3 Considerations for location-based mobile 
marketing
 
Location-based mobile marketing naturally presents a number of concerns and 
challenges when it comes to user privacy"
" No one wants their location published 
without their permission, and notifications that suddenly pop up in certain areas 
could prove highly annoying if control doesn’t remain in the hands of the user"
"
For this reason, marketers need to provide a method for people to unsubscribe"
" 
You could consider contacting users through alternative channels in order to check up on the service and allow them to customise the kinds of messages they receive"
" 
It must be said, however, that implementation has not always lived up to potential"
" 
Possibilities such as geographic report-backs on the efficacy of campaigns in 
certain areas could be immensely valuable, but all of these services and ideas need input from mobile operators, advertising networks and marketing agencies"
" 
Network operators often closely guard all user information"
 Not all devices have the same capabilities of revealing their location
" In other words, options seem 
endless, but beware of the hype"
"

"6 Mobile commerce
 
Mobile commerce covers a wide range of ways in which users can buy things through their mobile devices – whether it’s shopping from the mobile browser, 
paying with airtime for apps and games, or using the phone’s built-in technology 
at the point of sale"
"
Setting up a successful mobile commerce experience requires that you consider 
who your mobile customers are"
" What sorts of devices do they typically own? Are they comfortable with shopping online in general, and have they bought items on 
their mobile phones? Use these answers to inform your strategy"
"
Since there are so many physical, electronic and mobile payment options available, 
ensure that you cater to your market by providing a wide range of popular payment 
options"
 Do some research to discover what consumers in your region are using

People buy most things online"
" While the final purchase of a car may be uncommon, the research that goes into making this purchasing decision is often rooted in the 
online and mobile space"
" 
Apps and music are currently the most popular items bought through mobile 
devices, most likely because they involve smaller payments and less risk 
(Lightspeed Research, 2010)"
" This does not mean that other categories remain unexplored, however"
" The graphic below demonstrates that entertainment and 
content items dominate as the most popular currently"
"
Figure 10"
 Types of goods purchased over mobile phones
" (Nielsen/Yahoo, 2011)
There are various factors that influence a mobile shopper’s behaviour and 
interests"
" The device and its interface, as well the context within which shopping is 
explored, have a significant impact on a mobile user’s actions"
" Nielsen and Yahoo conducted research into mobile shopping and established nine mobile principles that define a user’s mobile shopping experience (Nielsen, 2011)"
"  
These are:
1"
 Location – Mobile ads should be relevant to a user’s current location
" 
2"
" Goal orientation – Users actively shop and look up category information and 
know what they need to do and how to achieve it"
3
 Attentiveness – Users often give their full attention to category information
" 
4"
 Killing time – Users access content because they are bored
"
5"
 Taking my time – Consumers use as much time as they need to complete a task
"
6"
 Urgency – Users experience a sense of urgency about completing a task
"
7"
" Routine – Users embrace the same method or process used to access 
category information"
"
8"
 Passion – They display a sense of enthusiasm about category information
"
9"
 Trust and security – Users want to access a trusted and secure source
"
Mobile commerce best practices
When building any mobile experience, and especially a mobile store, prioritise the 
user experience above everything else"
" Mobile users are purpose driven, search 
orientated, and clear on exactly what they are trying to locate – so make it as easy 
as possible for them to achieve their goal – which is to find and purchase an item"
" 
• Include a prominent search bar and incorporate auto-suggest to make 
searching easier and quicker"
"
• Keep the menu short and clear, with only the most important items displayed"
 Focus on goals rather than simply long lists of items or categories
"
• Make it easy to navigate by incorporating a prominent ‘back’ button at the 
top of every page"
"
• Lay out individual product pages simply, with the most important 
information at the top and a clear ‘buy’ button visible"
" 
• Include an ‘add to wishlist’ or ‘save this’ button so that customers can find 
their favourite items later"
" This is especially handy if you also have a full 
eCommerce site, since customers can browse and research on mobile and 
then evaluate their purchases later at their desktop computers"
"
• Use images to draw attention and illustrate products"
"
• Allow users to sort search results so that they can quickly find exactly what they want"
"
• Ensure that users do not have to register to make a purchase – many will abandon the process if they are forced to fill out a complex form on the small screen"
"
Build the payment system with good security, and reassure users that their details are secure – after all, most people are afraid of transacting on mobile because 
of security concerns"
" Include a privacy policy and information about the security 
measures you have taken for users who want to access this information"

 Program your full eCommerce site to redirect mobile customers to the mobi site to improve their experience
"
Finally, promote your mCommerce platform across your other media (your

"2 Near-Field Communication and mobile wallets
 
Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology allows data to be transferred over 
short distances through the use of data chips"
" This allows consumers to make 
payments on the spot by simply swiping or scanning their mobile device"
" In order 
for NFC to work, the consumer must have a chip in their mobile device and the merchant must have the hardware to scan that chip"
" NFC has become more common on smartphones, with almost 100 million mobile devices shipped in 2012 including the technology; however, it is not included on Apple’s iPhones yet 
(McNulty, 2013)"
"
A mobile wallet is a way of storing currency (or other payment methods, such 
as credit cards or PayPal account details) on a mobile device and then using the device to make payments"
 NFC is the most common technology used for this
" Mobile wallets are typically used to make small purchases, such as movie tickets, 
snacks from vending machines and public transport tickets, but can also be used 
for bigger purchases in place of a credit card"
"
Figure 11"
 Using a mobile phone to make an NFC payment
" (Jargon Media, 2011)NFC payment has the potential to provide a seamless experience for the user"

"3 Mobile ticketing and coupons
 
Mobile ticketing allows consumers to use their mobile devices to purchase and receive tickets for things such as their daily commute, secure parking, and concert 
seats"
"
Once a ticket has been purchased, a barcode, password or other identifiable piece 
of data is sent to the phone via SMS or MMS, and presented at the ticketing station"
" 
Mobile barcodes can be scanned quickly, making this paperless administration a lot easier, cheaper and more easily accessible"
" 
Mobile coupons work in a similar way"
" Customers can receive a coupon from the 
brand – for example, by subscribing to an SMS marketing list, as a reward for 
completing a USSD survey, or simply by walking near a location-based mobile 
offer in a store window"
" Coupons are excellent for driving sales, offering free trials, retaining customers and more – especially among customers in the young, mobile-native demographics"
"
According to Juniper Research, mobile ticketing transactions will quadruple to 23 
billion in 2016, from just 4 billion in 2011 (Juniper Research, 2012)"

"4 Mobile currency
 
This type of payment allows consumers to pay via a mobile phone using either e-currency or a mobile voucher"
" These are governed by the banking laws within 
a specific country"
" The major difference is the ability to draw money from the 
system"
" For merchants to make the most of these services, they must have online shopping enabled and register with the particular service"
" 
There are various options available, such as M-Pesa, which is available in many 
African countries"
" For developing regions such as Africa – where 95% of adults do 
not have bank accounts (Heinrich, 2012), but almost all have access to a mobile 
phone – this is a significant benefit"
" 
One of the key benefits of M-Pesa is that money can be sent by SMS or USSD, 
meaning that an Internet connection is not required"
" M-Pesa users can send e-money to other mobile users, regardless of their network provider"
 These mobile users can then convert the e-money back into cash via an M-Pesa outlet or a Nedbank ATM
" Outlets are available at retail stores, Nedbank branches and 
elsewhere"
 This type of currency can work for even the most basic phone

"5 Carrier-based payments 
 
Carrier-based payments make use of expensive premium messages"
" This means 
that mobile devices can be used to make or receive payments"
" All a user has to do 
is provide the merchant with his or her mobile number for the transaction"
" They 
are then sent a special code via an SMS and billed for the cost of this premium SMS from their airtime balance"
 The carrier will then receive payment and the merchant will get a portion of this payment
" Premium messages are usually used to sell mobile content such as ringtones, games, images, wallpapers and music"

"6 Airtime as currency
 
It is increasingly common for airtime to be used as a form of currency, especially in developing nations where traditional infrastructure is less freely available"
" As other 
payment options develop, this may change, but for the moment the significance of 
this method should not be ignored"
 Airtime has immense value for individuals who depend on their mobile devices for access to a number of services and who opt for prepaid rather than contract options for financial reasons

"7 Mobile banking
 
Mobile banking services are available through different mobile channels:
• Mobile web: Mobile web banking is when mobile users gain access to 
modified web versions of the bank’s online site"
" This means that users have full access to their accounts in order to make payments, transfer 
funds and more"
" Mobile banking through this channel doesn’t usually 
cost the user more than the online banking subscription"
" 
• Mobile app: Mobile banking applications give users the ability to access 
a variety of account features through simple mobile-friendly processes"
" Through apps, users will have full access to their accounts"
" 
• Mobile text: Mobile banking can also be conducted via SMS and USSD"
" 
This is useful for non-smartphone users"
" Mobile text banking involves banks sending alerts to customers via SMS, or allowing them to perform simple tasks, like transfers, via USSD"
" Alerts can be sent for account 
balances, payments, direct deposits, and other account activity"
" These 
services can be free or available at an additional cost, depending on the provider"
" The text messages themselves are for the consumer’s cost with 
their mobile phone carriers"

"8 Augmented reality
 
Augmented reality (AR) is a variation of virtual reality"
" Rather than immersing the 
user in a virtual world, however, AR takes computer graphics and superimposes 
them into ‘reality’ – the physical space around the person operating an AR device"
" 
These graphics can be 3D images or simply information tags about a location"
"
Google Glass is an exciting development in AR – this pair of glasses gives the 
viewer a digital data overlay over the real world"
"
While AR devices are relatively new, they do have a history outside their use in 
mobile"
" They can and have been used in medicine (superimposing surgical information onto a patient’s body), architecture (superimposing virtual buildings 
into a space where they are yet to be built), or for long-distance collaboration 
where participants can’t be in the same room"

The first use of AR in advertising was by HIT Lab NZ and Saatchi & Saatchi in 
2005 for an application for the Wellington Zoo, which allowed users to view virtual 
animals by pointing their phone cameras at printed bar codes (Heinrich, 2012)"
"
At present, applications have been interesting but often more gimmicky than 
useful"
" Some of the examples include an Ikea campaign that allowed people to 
view virtual versions of their furniture in their homes through their phone cameras (Butcher, 2010)"
"

"2 The future of augmented reality
 
AR is relatively new and still has a long way to go"
" Barriers such as development costs and user education have held it back, but with smartphones and specialised 
AR devices becoming more common, the potential for AR applications is increasing 
as well"
" 
Going forward, there are a number of challenges AR faces: investment in development 
and the potential for serious privacy concerns are the most notable"
" The image below illustrates what is possible when mobile, advertising, and geographical location are 
combined – exciting stuff"

"3 The quantified self
 
Another way in which mobile devices are adding a digital layer to the real world 
is through the trend of the ‘quantified self’, also referred to as personal analytics"
" 
In essence, this is the practice of using mobile devices to measure your physical 
behaviours in order to improve health, better understand your habits, get fitter and measure your daily life in more detail"
"
Some examples of this include:
• Step counters built in to mobile phones to measure how active you are
• Sleep-tracking apps that show how peacefully you sleep and what 
nightly rhythms and patterns you display
• Devices like the Nike+ FuelBand that measure exercise and calories burned
• Time-tracking apps to show how much time you spend reading emails, on social media, and more
 
17"
"9 Mobile analytics
 
Analytics for mobile sites and applications is a relatively young field, but given that 
anyone investing in a new technology is interested in return on investment, being 
able to track the effectiveness of your campaign is an essential part of mobile 
marketing"
"
Traditional analytics, focusing on the web rather than the mobile web, has come 
a long way in providing us with information about what keywords brought users to our sites, which referrers were used, and how long people spent on a page, as well 
as a number of other metrics"
" Through various tools, you can gain insight into your 
users’ actions and from there deduce information about their intent, using this to refine your web presence and campaigns"
" 
While some would argue that both spheres face data collection challenges, there 
is an understanding that mobile analytics presents more challenges in terms of 
sourcing reliable data"
" 
The first thing to acknowledge is that users of mobile analytics may be looking for 
different kinds of information"
" Given design challenges, primary information would 
include what device is being used, what network is being used, what browser is used, and then information about screen size"
"

NOTE
Read more about this 
in the Data Analytics chapter"
"NOTE
Do some research into 
the latest developments 
in AR technology - how 
much has changed 
since this textbook was 
published?"
"486 487Judah Phillips of Metrics Insider lists the following challenges for mobile analytics:
• Not all mobile browsers support JavaScript, meaning that the most 
common method for collecting data is not available on a lot of mobile 
devices"
" Mobile analytics packages have had to come up with alternative 
implementation methods such as packet-sniffers and accessing log files"
"
• Handset capability detection can be a challenge for some packages, and 
is not offered as a rule"
" If this information is important for your site, you may need to investigate carefully the analytics package you use"
"
Beyond this, however, there are a number of tools that have developed to provide mobile analytics data"
" Some of the ones most often discussed include the offerings 
from AdMob and Google Analytics, which are both available for free"
" Google 
Analytics for mobile offers options for tracking iPhone and Android applications, and for tracking mobile websites"
 Its server-side tracking options can be used to track sites on phones that don’t support JavaScript
"
17"
"10 Advantages and challenges
 
The mobile phone has many benefits but also comes with its own challenges"
" Many mobile marketing mediums need little audience education, but marketers need to 
be careful when creating more complicated campaigns and applications"
" If there 
is an extensive education process required in order for a campaign to succeed, it probably needs to be rethought"
"
Because the mobile phone is so personal, permission and privacy need to be at 
the core of any mobile campaign"
" Unlike the situation with email or web pages, 
where there is space available on screen to explain privacy and permission, there 
is very little real estate on a mobile device to do so"
 Ensure that you have very clear permission to market to the phone numbers on your database and that it is easy for users to opt out of receiving your messages
"
Mobile devices are even less standard than PCs"
" Not only do device models present 
myriad screen sizes; there are also several operating systems and browsers 
that are used"
 This can make standardising websites and campaign materials a challenge
" 
Mobile devices usually have a small screen and keypad or touch interface"
" When 
it comes to the mobile web, consider that devices do not have a mouse and full keyboard"
 These limited navigation options mean that inputting information and browsing can be harder

"11 Case study – Carling Black Label’s “Be the Coach”
17"
11
"1 One-line summary
Carling Black Label engaged soccer fans with an innovative and successful mobile campaign tailored for feature phones"
"
17"
11
"2 The problem
 
Carling Black Label, a well-known South African beer brand, wanted to engage its market in an unprecedented way"
" The target market they wanted to reach had a low Internet penetration 
rate, but had a high rate of mobile access"
" They knew that many Black Label drinkers are also 
passionate soccer fans – who, like all fans around the world, thought that perhaps they could do a good job at coaching their favourite team, Kaiser Chiefs"
" 
17"
11
"3 The solution
The brand identified that their target audience was active on mobile, but typically owned lower-end feature phones, so any mobile marketing campaign had to take this into account"
" 
To create a feeling of involvement in the sport, Black Label created the “Be the Coach” campaign"
" 
Using mobile devices, fans could choose players for the team and even substitute a player right in the middle of a match"
" The campaign was advertised on Black Label bottles, TV and radio, as well as other media"
" 
Fans used the code on the inside of the beer bottle cap to participate"
" Communicating through 
USSD, they voted on which players to include, and then participated during the live match by choosing which players should be substituted"
" 
A mobile site was also purpose-built for the campaign, where team, player and voting information 
could be viewed, and fans could access the “Be the Coach” Facebook and Twitter profiles"
" Participants used their mobile numbers to sign in to the site; this low barrier to entry made the 
campaign easily accessible"
" Web-enabled mobile devices could access the campaign information 
through the site in real time"
" 
Facebook ads, display ads and digital PR were also used to promote the campaign"
" Another 
important mobile aspect was the use of Mxit"
 The campaign was advertised for two weeks on this portal
 Fans could create a “Be the Coach” profile on Mxit and visit the mobile site from there

and offline marketing channels, since the mobile device can be physically located in the real-world 
space, and access the digital world at the same time"
"
We’ve listed earlier in this chapter some of the many marketing tactics of which mobile can form 
part"
" Mobile should also be a central consideration in your marketing and content strategy – 
consider the context of the user and how mobile content is consumed differently"
"
Mobile is also excellent in CRM and customer support, where it provides an always-on, always 
accessible channel to answer queries, resolve issues and reward customers"
"

"13 Summary
 
The mobile device cannot be ignored as an important tool in any marketing campaign"
" There are messaging capabilities unique to mobile that can be very effective – from SMS to USSD and 
Bluetooth"
"
Exciting technological developments also open up the opportunities for interactive campaigns and 
mobile experiences"
" Although not widely adopted yet, QR codes can be the point of interaction that 
connects other media to the mobile device"
 Augmented reality campaigns can also create a rich interactive experience for a user by adding a layer of information to the real world
"
As with any digital marketing approach, planning is vital"
" While mobile can offer a dazzling array 
of marketing and communication opportunities, knowing your audience will help you to best plan those most suited to your market and your campaign"

"4 The results
Over seven weeks of voting, the campaign created intense discussion among fans, players, coaches and journalists"
" It also garnered some incredibly impressive results:
• Fans voted more than 10"
5 million times over the seven-week voting period
"
• A record 85 000 tickets to the game were sold, and millions more watched from home"
" 
• The Facebook and Twitter accounts grew by 450%  and 600%  respectively"
" 
• The equivalent PR value of all this attention came in at over R83 million"
" 
• The mobi site had 31 088 visitors (18 405 of these were unique), and users visited 
6"
"97 pages on average, with an average time on site of 5 minutes 30 seconds"
" 
On the day of the game, rival team Orlando Pirates won, but the fans did get to “Be the Coach” for 
Kaiser Chiefs (Ogilvy & Mather South Africa, n"

)
"

"12 The bigger picture
 
Mobile communications should always be considered in context within your other marketing communications"
" The mobile channel is not a separate one, but rather one that can be accessed 
and integrated with many other forms of communication"
" 
One of mobile’s powerful characteristics is its ability to stitch media together – especially online "

"Part 4
Optimise"
"496Introduction to Optimise
Planning, research and strategy are important for executing digital marketing 
campaigns that resonate with audiences"
" As part of executing these strategies, 
you need to create digital assets, and then use various channels to drive traffic to 
those assets, and build relationships with your visitors"
"
As you are doing all of this, it’s important to know: is it actually working? And how 
might it all work better?
This is where Optimise comes in: the process by which we track, analyse and 
optimise our digital assets and campaigns to achieve the best results"
" (Yes, that’s 
track, analyse and optimise, or TAO, so you’ll never forget it"
")
As Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google, said: “The Internet will transform 
advertising because of its trackability, not its beauty"
"” Because most actions online 
are recorded, we can build a rich, data-driven picture of how our digital assets and online campaigns are performing"
" Digital allows us to use this data to test and improve our marketing efforts – and then release new, better versions of 
campaigns rapidly"
"
With user-friendly reporting interfaces and free, powerful web analytics tools such 
as Google Analytics, there is no excuse for not knowing what’s happening in your campaigns"
" The chapter on Data Analytics will help you with the concepts and definitions you need, and will also help you to set objectives and key performance 
indicators (KPIs) so that you know what you need to measure"
"
It’s easy to rely on web analytics tools to report the ‘what’ without applying your 
brain to understand the ‘why’ – and the ‘what next’"
" 
The chapter on Conversion Optimisation takes you through the steps of turning 
data into something useful: insights that let you transform website visitors into 
active customers"
"
Getting into a routine of using data to understand how your visitors are behaving 
and how you might influence that behaviour is what conversion optimisation is 
about"
" You need to use the web analytics data not just to report on how campaigns 
and digital assets are performing, but also to understand how to make them perform better"
"Optimise  ›  Introduction
What’s inside:  You will learn about the different types of web analytics packages, and 
the benefits and challenges of each"
" The metrics for data analytics are introduced, as well as 
an approach to understanding and analysing web data"
" Single page analysis packages and 
approaches are also explained"

"1 Introduction
Picture the scene: you’ve opened up a new fashion retail outlet in the trendiest 
shopping centre in town"
 You’ve spent a small fortune on advertising and branding
" 
You’ve gone to great lengths to ensure that you’re stocking all of the prestigious 
brands"
" Come opening day, your store is inundated with visitors and potential customers"
" 
And yet, you are hardly making any sales"
" Could it be because you have one cashier 
for every hundred customers? Or possibly it’s the fact that the smell of your freshly 
painted walls chases customers away before they complete a purchase? 
While it can be difficult to isolate and track the factors affecting your revenue in 
this fictional store, move it online and you have a wealth of resources available to 
assist you with tracking, analysing and optimising your performance"
"
To a marketer, the Internet offers more than just new avenues of creativity"
" By its 
very nature, it allows you to track each click to your site and through your site"
" It takes the guesswork out of pinpointing the successful elements of a campaign, 
and can show you very quickly what’s not working"
" It all comes down to knowing 
where to look, what to look for, and what to do with the information you find"
"
In this chapter, you will learn:
• How to set solid objectives, goals and measurements for your digital 
marketing campaigns
• How to capture web analytics data, and what data you can find 
• Techniques and guidelines for analysing data to better understand your web visitors

"3 Working with data
 
In the days of traditional media, actionable data was a highly desired but scarce 
commodity"
" While it was possible to broadly understand consumer responses to 
marketing messages, it was often hard to pinpoint exactly what was happening, 
and why"
" 
In the digital age, information is absolutely everywhere"
" Every single action taken 
online is recorded, which means there is an incredible wealth of data available to marketers to help them understand when, where, how and even why people react 
to their marketing campaigns"
" 
This also means there is a responsibility on marketers to make data-driven 
decisions"
" Assumptions and gut feel are not enough – you need to back these up 
with solid facts and clear results"
"
Don’t worry if you’re not a ‘numbers’ person – working with data is very little about 
number crunching (the technology usually takes care of this for you) and a lot about analysing, experimenting, testing and questioning"
" All you need is a curious 
mind and an understanding of the key principles and tools"
"
Here are some data concepts you should be aware of"
"
18"
3
"1 Performance monitoring and trends
 
Data analytics is all about monitoring user behaviour and marketing campaign 
performance over time"
 The last part is crucial
" There is little value in looking at 
a single point of data – you want to look at trends and changes over a set period"
" 
For example, it is quite meaningless to say that 10% of this month’s web traffic 
converted – is that good or bad, high or low? But saying that 10% more people 
converted this month, as opposed to last month, shows a positive change or trend"
" While it can be tempting to focus on single ‘hero’ numbers and exciting-looking 
figures (‘Look, we have 5 000 Facebook fans!’), these really don’t give a full picture 
if they are not presented in context"
" 
18"
3
"2 Big data 
 
‘Big data’ is the term used to describe truly massive data sets – the ones that are so big and unwieldy that they require specialised software and massive computers 
to process"
" Companies like Google, Facebook and YouTube generate and collect so 
much data every day that they have entire warehouses full of hard drives to store it all"
"Understanding how it works and how to think about data on this scale provides 
some valuable lessons for all analysts"
"
• Measure trends, not absolute figures"
" The more data you have, the more 
meaningful it is to look at how things change over time"
"
• Focus on patterns"
" With enough data, patterns over time should become 
apparent – consider looking at weekly, monthly or even seasonal flows"
"
• Investigate anomalies"
" If your expected pattern suddenly changes, try 
to find out why – and use this information to inform your actions going 
forward"
"
18"
3
"3 Data mining
 
Data mining is the process of finding patterns that are hidden in large numbers and databases"
" Rather than having a human analyst process the information, an 
automated computer program pulls apart the data and matches it to known pat
-
terns to deliver insights"
" Often, this can reveal surprising and unexpected results, 
and tends to break assumptions"
"
Data mining in action: Target
US retail chain Target uses data mining to market specific products to consumers 
based on their personal contexts"
" Target gathers a range of personal, psychographic and demographic data from customers and then analyses this against their 
shopping habits"
" They analyse their data and predict the products customers might 
be interested in, based on their lifestyle needs and choices (Duhigg, 2012)"
" 
Each customer is given a unique code called the Guest ID number"
" This is linked 
to all interactions the customer has with the brand, from using a credit card or calling in to the help line, to opening an email"
" They then gather data, including 
the following:
• Age 
• Marital status
• Whether the customer has children, and how many 
• Estimated salary
• Location
• Whether they’ve moved house recently
• Which credit cards they use
• Which websites they visit Data Analytics  ›  Working with data Data Analytics  ›  Working with data

expected data, good or 
bad, and investigate any 
anomalies"
 
"502 503Target is also able to buy data on their customers from other companies to 
supplement this, like:
• Ethnicity
• Employment history
• Favourite magazines
• Financial status
• Whether they’ve been divorced
• Which college they attended
• Their online interests
• Their favourite coffee brands
• Political leanings
For example, Target markets baby and pregnancy-related products to expectant 
moms and dads, from as early as the second trimester"
" How do they know to 
do this? Using this data, combined with customer shopping habits, Target has created a pregnancy-predictor model, determining whether a woman was pregnant (sometimes even before she knew it herself)"
" 
One father of a teenage girl complained to the store about sending his daughter 
marketing materials of this nature – but apologised to the retailer a short 
while later, after discovering that his teenage daughter was in fact pregnant, indicating that the predictor model did actually work (Duhigg, 2012)"
"
However, Target has decided to be a bit subtler in how they use their valuable 
insights!

"4 A world of data
 
Another consideration to keep in mind is that data can be found and gathered from a variety of sources – you don’t need to restrict yourself simply to website-based 
analytics"
" To get a full picture of audience insights, try to gather as wide a variety 
of information as you can"
" Some places to look:
• Online data – aside from your website, look at other places your audience interacts with you online, such as social media, email, forums and more"
" Most of these will have their own data-gathering tools (for example, look 
at Facebook Insights or your email service provider’s send logs)"
"
• Databases – look at any databases that store relevant customer 
information, like your contact database, CRM information or loyalty programs"
" These can often supplement anonymous data with some 
tangible demographic insights"
"• Software data – data might also be gathered by certain kinds of software (for example, some web browsers gather information on user habits, 
crashes, problems and so on)"
" If you produce software, consider adding a data-gathering feature (with the user’s permission, of course) that captures usage information that you can use for future updates"
"
• App store data – app store analytics allows companies to monitor 
and analyse the way people download, pay for and use their apps"
 Marketplaces like the Google and Apple app stores should provide some useful data here
"
• Offline data – and don’t forget all the information available off the web – such as point-of-sale records, customer service logs, in-person surveys, 
in-store foot traffic, and much more"
"

"4 Setting objectives, goals and KPIs
 
The key to success for any website or online campaign is designing it with specific, 
unique, clearly defined objectives in mind"
" These are used to measure the success 
of the website or campaign, and are crucial to maintaining focus within online 
activities"
" Sometimes, words such as ‘objective’ or ‘goal’ can be used in different situations with slightly different meanings"
" For the sake of clarity, this chapter will use them as described below"
"
The objective of a website or online campaign is aligned with the strategic 
outcomes of the business"
" The objective answers the question, “What do we want 
to achieve with this marketing campaign?” For example, an objective might be to increase sales of a product, grow brand awareness or increase website traffic"
"
The goal of a website or campaign in web analytics refers to an action that a user 
takes on a website or a type of user behaviour"
" This action could be making a 
purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or viewing a certain number of pages in a 
visit"
 A completed goal is called a conversion
" Goals are derived from objectives, and answer the question, “What do we need users to do in order to achieve our objective?”
Key performance indicators or KPIs are metrics that are used to indicate whether 
objectives are being met"
" There are many metrics to be analysed, and determining 
which are important will help to focus on what really matters to a particular campaign"
" KPIs relate closely to goals, and answer the question, “What data do we need to look at to see if goals are being completed?” For example, if your objective 
is to increase website traffic, you may look at the number of website visitors, the 
percentage of new visitors, and how long users stay on the site"
"NOTE
Goals related to visitor 
behaviour, such as time spent on site or pageviews per visit, are referred to as engagement goals"
"Data Analytics  ›  Setting objectives, goals and KPIs Data Analytics  ›  Working with data
NOTE
Do you think Target’s 
behaviour was ethical 
and appropriate? Is this 
an invasion of customer 
privacy?"
504 505Figure 1
" Objectives, goals and KPIs"
" (Adapted from Kaushik, 2010)
Targets are the actual target values that KPIs need to meet in order for the 
campaign to be declared a success"
" If one KPI is ‘newsletter subscriptions’, then a target might be ‘100 subscriptions every month’ – if one month falls short at 70, 
this will quickly reveal that a fix is required"
"
Although a website has an ultimate goal, the process of achieving that goal can 
be broken down into several steps"
 These are called events or micro-conversions
 Analysing each step in the process is called funnel analysis or path analysis and is critical to understanding where problems in the conversion process may lie
" 
For example, on a hotel website, the ultimate goal is that visitors to the site make 
a booking on the website with a credit card"
"
Each step in the process is an event that can be analysed as a conversion point"
"
Event 1: Perform a search for available dates for hotels in the desired area"
"
Event 2: Check prices and amenities for available hotels"
"
Event 3: Select a hotel and go to checkout"
Event 4: Enter personal and payment details and confirm booking (conversion)
"
One naturally expects fewer users at each step"
" Increasing the number of visitors 
who progress from one step to the next will go a long way to improving the overall conversion rate of the site"

NOTE
Remember to make 
your objectives SMART"
" For a refresher on what this means, have a look at the Digital Marketing Strategy chapter"
""
506 507KPIs help you to look at the factors you can influence in the conversion process
" 
For example, if your objective is to increase revenue, you could look at ways of 
increasing your conversion rate (that is, the number of visitors who purchase 
something)"
 One way of increasing your conversion rate could be to offer a discount
" So, you would have more sales, but probably a lower average order value"
" Or, you could look at ways of increasing the average order value, so that 
the conversion rate would stay the same, but you would increase the revenue from 
each conversion"
"
Once you have established your objectives, goals and KPIs, you need to track the 
data that will help you to analyse how you are performing, and will indicate how you can optimise your website or campaign"

"5 Tracking and collecting data
 
Currently, there are two main approaches for collecting web analytics data: cookie-based tracking, and server-based tracking"
" A third option, called universal 
analytics, is set to dramatically change how data is gathered and analysed"
" 
Universal analytics is one of the most exciting examples of non-cookie-based server tracking"
" 
18"
5
"1 How information is captured
Cookie-based tracking
The most common method of capturing web analytics is to use cookie-based tracking"
" Here’s how it works:
1"
 The analyst adds a page tag (a piece of JavaScript code) to every page of the website
" 
2"
 A user accesses the page using their browser
"
3"
" When the browser loads the page, it runs the page tag code"
" 
4"
" This tag sends an array of information to a third-party server (like Google 
Analytics), a service that stores and collates the data"
"
5"
 The analyst accesses this data by logging in to the third-party server
" 
The data gathered this way can capture a wide array of factors about each visitor, 
from their device, operating system and screen resolution, to their long-term behaviour on your website"
" This is currently the most common option for most 
website tracking"
" Server-based tracking
Web servers are the computers that websites are stored on so that they can be 
accessed online"
" Server-based tracking involves looking at log files – documents 
that are automatically created by servers and that record all clicks that take place 
on the server"
" A new line is written in a log file every time a new request is made – for example, clicking on a link or submitting a form"
"
Server-based tracking is very useful for tracking mobile visitors (since many 
phones cannot execute the cookie-based JavaScript tags) and is also essential for 
universal analytics, discussed below"
"
Comparing the options
Cookie-based tracking Server-based tracking
Page tagging requires changes to the 
website and can be used by companies that do not run their own web servers"
"Log files are produced by web servers, so the raw data is readily available, but the company must have access to the server"
"
Cookie-based tracking can be less accurate than server-based tracking"
" If a user’s browser does not support JavaScript, for example, no information will be captured"
Log files are very accurate – they record every click
 Log files also record visits from search engine spiders – useful for search engine optimisation
"
Page tags are proprietary to each vendor, so switching can mean losing historical data"
"Log files are in a standard format, so it is possible to switch vendors and still be able to analyse historical data"
"
Page tagging shows only successful page requests"
Log files record failed page requests
"
JavaScript makes it easier to capture more information (e"
g
" products purchased, or the version of a user’s browser)"
"Server-based tracking can capture some detailed information, but this involves modifying the URLs"
"
JavaScript tracking can report on events such as interactions with a Flash movie"
Server-based tracking cannot report on events
"
Third-party page tagging service providers usually offer a good level of support"
 Log file analysis software is often managed in-house
"
 
Because these two options use different methods of collecting data, the raw figures 
produced will differ"
" For example, caching occurs when a browser stores some of 
the information for a web page, so that it can retrieve it more quickly when you return"
 Opening this cached page will not send a request to the server
" This means 
that the visit won’t show up in the log files, but would be captured by page tags"
" Data Analytics  ›  Tracking and collecting data Data Analytics  ›  Setting objectives, goals and KPIs
NOTE
Pixel tracking can be 
used to track email campaigns"
" Here, a tiny 1 x 1 pixel is placed in the email"
" When you load the images in the email, you will also load the tiny image that tracks your activity"
""
"508 509Website analytics packages can be used to measure most, if not all, digital 
marketing campaigns"
" Website analysis should always account for the various 
campaigns being run"
" For example, generating high traffic volumes by employing 
various digital marketing tactics such as SEO, PPC and email marketing can prove to be a pointless and costly exercise if visitors are leaving your site without achieving one (or more) of your website’s goals"
" Conversion optimisation aims to 
convert as many of a website’s visitors as possible into active customers"
"
Universal analytics
Google recently announced a new feature in its analytics suite called universal 
analytics"
" The biggest problem web analysts have faced up until now is that they 
can’t actually track individual people – only individual browsers (or devices), since 
this is done through cookies"
" So, if Joe visits the website from Chrome on his home computer, and Safari on his work laptop, the website will think he’s two different people"
" And if Susan visits the site from the home computer, also using Chrome, 
the website will think she’s the same user as Joe"
"
An additional concern is that cookies are on the decline"
" Most modern browsers 
allow users to block them, and many mobile devices simply can’t access or execute them"
" With growing consumer privacy concerns, and new laws like the EU Privacy 
Directive (which requires all European websites to disclose their cookie usage), 
cookies are falling out of favour"
"
Universal analytics allows you to track visitors (that means real people) rather 
than simply sessions"
" By creating a unique identifier for each customer, universal analytics means you can track the user’s full journey with the brand, regardless 
of the device or browser they use"
" So, that means you can track Joe on his home 
computer, work laptop, mobile phone during his lunch break, and even when he swipes his loyalty card at the point of sale"
" 
Crucially, however, tracking Joe across devices requires both universal analytics 
and authentication on the site across devices – in other words, Joe has to be 
logged in to your website or online tool on his desktop, work laptop and mobile 
phone in order to be tracked this way"
" If he doesn’t log in, we won’t know it’s the same person"
"
You can see: 
• How visitors behave depending on the device they use (browsing for quick 
ideas on their smartphone, but checking out through the eCommerce portal on their desktop)
• How visitor behaviour changes the longer they are a fan of the brand – do they come back more often, for longer, or less often but with a clearer purpose?
• How often they’re really interacting with your brand
• What their lifetime value and engagement isAnother useful feature of universal analytics is that it allows you to import data 
from other sources into Google Analytics – for example, CRM information or 
data from a point-of-sale cash register"
" This gives a much broader view of the 
customers and lets you see a more direct link between your online efforts and real-world behaviour"

"2 The type of information captured
 
KPIs are the metrics that help you understand how well you are meeting your objectives"
 A metric is a defined unit of measurement
" Definitions can vary between 
various web analytics vendors depending on their approach to gathering data, but 
the standard definitions are provided here"
"
Web analytics metrics are divided into:
• Counts – these are the raw figures that will be used for analysis"
"
• Ratios – these are interpretations of the data that is counted"
"
Metrics can be applied to three different groupings:
• Aggregate – all traffic to the website for a defined period of time"
"
• Segmented – a subset of all traffic according to a specific filter, such as 
by campaign (PPC) or visitor type (new visitor vs"
 returning visitor)
"
• Individual – the activity of a single visitor for a defined period of time"
"
Here are some of the key metrics you will need to get started on with website analytics"
"
Building-block terms
These are the most basic web metrics"
" They tell you how much traffic your website 
is receiving"
" For example, looking at returning visitors can tell you how well your 
website creates loyalty; a website needs to grow the number of visitors who come 
back"
 An exception may be a support website – repeat visitors could indicate that the website has not been successful in solving the visitor’s problem
 Each website needs to be analysed based on its purpose
"
• Hit – one page load (though this is an outdated terms that we recommend 
you avoid using)"
"
• Page – unit of content (so downloads and Flash files can be defined as 
pages)"
"
• Page views – the number of times a page was successfully requested"
"NOTE

this in the Conversion 
Optimisation chapter"
"Data Analytics  ›  Tracking and collecting data Data Analytics  ›  Tracking and collecting data
NOTE
Universal analytics is a 
powerful leap forward in data analytics"
 How might this affect how brands understand their customers? And what privacy concerns may users have?
"510 511• Visit or session – an interaction by an individual with a website consisting 
of one or more page views within a specified period of time"
"
• Unique visitors – the number of individual people visiting the website one or more times within a set period of time"
" Each individual is counted 
only once"
"
o New visitor – a unique visitor who visits the website for the first time 
ever in the period of time being analysed"
"
o Returning visitor – a unique visitor who makes two or more visits (on the same device and browser) within the time period being analysed"
"
Figure 3"
 A breakdown of new versus returning visitors in Google Analytics
"
Visit characteristics
These are some of the metrics that tell you how visitors reach your website, and how they move through the website"
" The way that a visitor navigates a website is 
called a click path"
" Looking at the referrers, both external and internal, allows you 
to gauge the click path that visitors take"
"
• Entry page – the first page of a visit"
"
• Landing page – the page intended to identify the beginning of the user experience resulting from a defined marketing effort"
"
• Exit page – the last page of a visit"
"
• Visit duration – the length of time in a session"
Figure 4
 Visitor behaviour in Google Analytics
"
• Referrer – the URL that originally generated the request for the current 
page"
"
o Internal referrer – a URL that is part of the same website"
"
o External referrer – a URL that is outside of the website"
"
o Search referrer – a URL that is generated by a search function"
"
o Visit referrer – a URL that originated from a particular visit"
"
o Original referrer – a URL that sent a new visitor to the website"
"
• Clickthrough – the number of times a link was clicked by a visitor"
"
• Clickthrough rate – the number of times a link was clicked divided by the 
number of times it was seen (impressions)"
"
• Page views per visit – the number of page views in a reporting period 
divided by the number of visits in that same period to get an average of 
how many pages are being viewed per visit"
"
Content characteristics
When a visitor views a page, they have two options: leave the website, or view another page on the website"
" These metrics tell you how visitors react to 
your content"
" Bounce rate can be one of the most important metrics that you 
measure"
" There are a few exceptions, but a high bounce rate usually means high dissatisfaction with a web page"
"
• Page exit ratio – number of exits from a page divided by total number of page views of that page"
"
• Single page visits – visits that consist of one page, even if that page was viewed a number of times"
"
• Bounces (or single page view visits) – visits consisting of a single page view"
"
• Bounce rate – single page view visits divided by entry pages"
"
Data Analytics  ›  Tracking and collecting data Data Analytics  ›  Tracking and collecting data
NOTE
New visitors show that 
you are reaching new 
audiences and markets, 
while returning visitors 
are an indicator of brand 
loyalty"
" Most websites 
should aim for a healthy 
balance between the two"
"
NOTE
A high bounce rate is 
not always bad"
" On a blog, for example, most people click through from a search to read one article and, having satisfied their curiosity, leave without visiting any other pages"
""
"512 513Conversion metrics
These metrics give insight into whether you are achieving your analytics goals (and 
through those, you overall website objectives)"
"
• Event – a recorded action that has a specific time assigned to it by the browser or the server"
"
• Conversion – a visitor completing a target action"
"
Figure 5"
 Goal conversions in Google Analytics
"
Mobile metrics
When it comes to mobile data, there are no special, new or different metrics to use"
" However, you will probably be focusing your attention on some key aspects 
that are particularly relevant here – namely technologies and the user experience"
"
• Device category – whether the visit came from a desktop, mobile or 
tablet device"
" 
• Mobile device info – the specific brand and make of the mobile device"
"
• Mobile input selector – the main input method for the device (e"
g
" touchscreen, clickwheel, stylus)"
"
• Operating system – the OS that the device runs (some popular ones 
include iOS, Android and BlackBerry)"

"
Now that you know what tracking is, you can use your objectives and KPIs to define 
what metrics you’ll be tracking"
" You’ll then need to analyse these results, and take appropriate actions"
" Then the testing begins again!

"6 Analysing data
 
In order to test the success of your website, you need to remember the TAO of conversion optimisation:
Track – Analyse – Optimise
A number is just a number until you can interpret it"
" Typically, it is not the raw 
figures that you will be looking at, but what they tell you about how your users are 
interacting with your website"
" Because your web analytics package will never be able to provide you with 100% accurate results, you need to analyse trends and changes over time to understand your brand’s performance"
"

"1 Key elements to analyse
 
Avinash Kaushik, author of Web Analytics: An Hour a Day, recommends a three-pronged approach to web analytics:
1"
 Analysing behaviour data infers the intent of a website’s visitors
" Why are 
people visiting the website?
2"
" Analysing outcomes metrics shows how many visitors performed the 
goal actions on a website"
" Are visitors completing the goals we want 
them to?
3"
 A wide range of data tells us about the user experience
" What are the 
patterns of user behaviour? How can we influence them so that we achieve our objectives?
NOTE
Google Analytics can 
send you email alerts whenever something unusual happens on your website"
 Simply set a triggering condition and decide what sort of report you want to receive
" For example, you may want to know if more than a certain number of people have accessed your site in one day – this could mean an opportunity to capitalise on high traffic"
"
